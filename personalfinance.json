The sooner you pay it off the less interest you pay and most of the time the rate is lower and a shorter term.  It's all your choice. Example if you want to get a car for 5 years installment and the price is 1.2m you can get that car for only 20k per month but depends on your down payment if your downpayment is 300k you can get that car for 12k per month for 5 years. I think the more down payment you have is also a good strategy. Other than the fact longer financing usually has higher rates, if you can finance longer, but pay much more, you will save money without the added risk of HAVING to pay the extra. This is ONLY if you have the discipline to do that. Few things to consider:\n\n1. For your age and income, most likely you will not qualify for low-interest rate irrespective of the loan tenure. For rate > 2.99% don't go for a long term loan. I would suggest asking your parents to co-sign the loan(if they are comfortable and you think it would put a dent in their financial security if you fail to pay for the car) if that helps you in getting a lower interest rate.\n\n2. When you have a lien on the car, the lender will want an auto insurance policy according to his requirements and it can be expensive especially if you are < 25 years. Double check the insurance quotes based on lender's requirements because you will need that level of insurance until the loan is repaid fully. Again adding to your parents' insurance policy will be cheaper.\n\n3. It also depends on what other loans you anticipate to take in next 3-6 years. Your ability to get another loan will be less because the lender will check your repayment capability and see that you are already making monthly payments towards your car.\n\n ", "date": 1483257600.0, "upvotes": 1, "flair": "Should I finance a car for a long time with low monthly payments, or quick and high monthly?"}{"body": "My husband's grandfather passed away last week.

Please help me understand, I love finance so far but this is driving me nuts. Thanks. ", "title": "Struggling to grasp the inverse relationship between bond price and bond yield", "comments": "Here's how to think about it.\n\nYou buy a bond that yields 10% interest and matures in 10 years.\n\nNow, the interest rate goes down.  Everything else is earning only 5% interest.  Your bond is still earning 10% interest.  Of course, people will pay more than the face value of your bond to buy it from you, because they can not get that interest stream any where else.  In fact they will bid the price of the bond up to where the interest stream is worth what they can get elsewhere (5%).  Especially if the bond is essentially risk free (ie government bonds, rather than corporate bonds).\n\nSo, if interest rates are falling, the price of bonds will rise.  Conversely, if interest rates are rising the price of bonds will fall.\n\nIf you hold a bond to maturity, you will get all your money back, plus the interest rate on the bond every year.  However, if you sell the bond before maturity, the price will reflect the opportunity cost (or benefit) of the difference between the interest rate on the bond, and the interest rate in the market for assets of similar risk. You have a $100 face value one year bond with a 10% nominal yield.  If you held the bond to maturity, you would collect $10 in interest.\n\nLater on the day the bond is issued, it is now trading at $90.  The bond, assuming the company doesn't go bankrupt, will still give you $10 in interest plus your $100 in principal.  It's yield is now 22% --($100+$10)/$90=122% (aka -- 22% yield).\n\nAlternatively, say your bond is now trading at $105.  Same deal - except your yield is now 4.8% -- ($100+$10)/$105.\n\nSo... in the first scenario, price went down, yield went up.  Second scenario: price went up, yield went down.\n\nThe reason *why* bonds change price is a function of both expectations that the money will be paid back, and a function of overall market interest conditions. You buy a bond now at the given rate & consequently a given cash inflow that doesn't change (for fix rate bonds).\n\nMarket interest rate changes, but your bond's cash flows are fixed.\n\nIf you were to sell, you sell at the current market rate. The price of your bond is the present value of the cash flow divided by the current market interest rate. Thus the inverse relationship. If a bond's price goes up, perhaps because interest rates went down overall, then the interest payments are now being computed on a higher cost basis, so the yield is now lower for the same interest payments.  http://www.kevinoninvesting.com/2016/12/bond-basics-part-1.html \" A $5 interest payment is always a percentage of something.\"\n\nA bond pays a constant interest payment (say $5, often called the coupon).

I know the general idea is that one can deduct up to $3,000 per year against income, if you suffer a realized capital loss that goes above that amount.  And I know that people will occasionally sell stocks at a loss in order to deduct those losses against gains.  But there are a couple of things I don't understand:\n\n1) Why doesn't the $3,000 per year adjust with inflation?  Isn't that limit effectively becoming lower every year?\n2) Why is that limit so low?  In large crashes and panic sales, lots of people lose way more than that at a time.  So it seems like it could take more than a lifetime to deduct all of the losses from a really bad year (with a large enough investment).  (e.g.: one PF redditor mentioned a realized loss of $200k.  That would take 67 years to recoup using Capital Loss Carryover!)\n3) Are there other ways to deduct losses against capital gains or income that I'm failing to recognize?  It just seems like these methods get way more attention than the few grand a year that they can save.\n\nOverall, it seems like people make a big deal about the amazing benefits of tax loss harvesting.

But it seems like a pretty limited way of mitigating the damage of some major losses.\n\nThose losses carried forward can be helpful if you are going to have gains in future years, because you can offset those gains in the future and not pay any taxes on them.  If you think you will never ever have any capital gains ever again for the rest of your life, then you're right, the carryover is not very valuable (but it is still not without value).  But if you do expect to have some gains someday, then they can be useful, because there is no limit (the limit is only on offsetting other non-capital-gain income).\n\nHere's an example for you:  During the crash in 2008, many of my investments had big losses.  The person managing some of my accounts suggested that we sell most of them, and then on the same day buy back different, but similar investments.  The replacements were different enough to allow me to avoid the \"wash sale\" rule, but still rack up some big losses on paper, even though I actually remained in the market (yes, I wasn't one of those who left the market and missed out on the big gains that followed, fortunately).  For years after that, I paid no taxes at all on any of my gains, because I had all those paper losses carried forward that I could offset them with.\n\n [removed] You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Tax Software Megathread](http://redd.it/5ohy01)\n- [Taxes wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)\n- [Understanding tax brackets](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes#wiki_eli5.3A_taxable_income.2C_tax_brackets.2C_marginal_tax_rates)\n- [W-4 IRS Withholding Calculator](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I presented the case as to what I would offer to be a more valuable employee and decided to ask for $15K. \n\nMy supervisor said they would have to think it over and bring it up the chain. They asked \"If we come back to you and it turns out we're only able to do $5K....how do you think that might affect your decision-making?\" \n\nI think they were trying to figure out if I had an offer on the table, if I was close to leaving, or if I would just have been content with the $5K. (I mean, if it came to $5K versus nothing, obviously I would be happy with it). But I knew if I said, \"Oh, well of course I'd be fine with just $5K, I just thought I would ask,\" that would be showing my hand. \n\nSo I said, \"Hmm. It's hard to say how I would feel. I think I would just have to cross that bridge if I came to it.\"\n\n24 hours later my boss came back and said they couldn't do $15K but they could meet in the middle and do $10K. So, started the workweek on Monday without any inkling of this and ended up negotiating an extra $5k! Thank you!\n\n\nQuick background: \n\n* Been at my company for about 10 years\n* Currently making $68K\n* Similar positions in my market, for my level of experience, are in that range, anywhere from $55K to $85K (I think)\n* In the past year, about 25% of our department has left and two people just announced they are leaving. Our industry has a high turnover anyway but this is pretty big. \n\nIn the transition period, my boss asked to talk to me about my goals, long-term plans, etc. I really like what I'm doing, but I definitely have been thinking about moving from my current company. I'd like to get experience at another organization.\n\nOut of the blue my supervisor offered me a promotion and $5K raise. My job responsibilities mostly wouldn't change or my KPIs. This is definitely coming about because they don't want to lose any more people. I am glad they are being proactive in talking to the remaining employees about professional development and growth.\n\nA senior colleague advised me to ask for more---they were in on preliminary offer discussions and said at one point they discussed offering $10K to myself and another employee. They suggested counteroffering and also offering to take on more responsibility so that I'm actually trying to give something rather than just seem like I'm ungrateful with $5K and trying to get more.\n\nThere are a couple other people in my department who are being talked to about this as well so I know it's not just me who may be negotiating. And we have to stick within a budget, etc. etc. but the wiggle room for this is coming from the salaries of the departing employees.\n\nShould I just be grateful for the unexpected $5K bump and title promotion, or try to negotiate more? Our department has a history of being pretty un-systematic when it comes to things like title changes, raises, promotions, etc. In 10 years I've been there I have not seen any clear path or metrics to how it works---it's almost feels like you need to be in the right place at the right time, be a decently valuable employee, and ask at the right time.\n\nThe only other time I was able to leverage something was a few years ago when I got a job offer from another company.

Loyalty should be rewarded, and 5k with additional responsibilities doesn't sound as much like a reward as it is a feeble attempt to see if you'll take the bait.  Be clear about what you provide in terms of value, what you want to provide in the future, and how you are a much more valuable member than what they are paying you.  Be cool about it, don't make it an ultimatum, but make it a clear case that they want to keep you, and keep you happy.  Ask for 15, settle for 10. You kind of have to trust the way you appraise yourself as an employee. If the mere idea of you leaving is enough to bring you to the negotiation table that probably says something, and if you feel that your work is worth more than you make, that should say the rest. I think it is appropriate and correct to have your say on wages, just do it respectfully and make your stance clear.

I just don't see it happening, but I'm willing to listen. \n", "title": "[Cell Phones] How to get a lower price (USA)", "comments": "First of all, if you want to save money don't buy top tier phones that are so expensive. Pick up ones that are used, a generation or two old for next to nothing.\n\nSecond, learn to use wifi. Almost everyone I know that complains about their phone bill being to high is because they pay for way more data than they need to on their plans because they don't effectively use the wifi they have available to them. Make sure that when you are at home or work, you are connecting to those networks.\n\nLook for the MVNOs. Straight talk is a good example. Depending on the phone it uses the Sprint or Verizon network, but is like $45 a month per line. I personally love republic wireless. I pay $20 a month for unlimited talk, text and 1gb of data. I never go over that as I'm mostly always around wifi!  If you pay $77 for 4 devices or $60 for two phones that's not a bad deal. Normally I recommend Cricket which would be $70/month for 2 phones with 3GB data each, or $100 for 4 phones/tablets. They are owned by AT&T and use their network, so that would be something to consider if you aren't happy with T-Mobile's coverage.\n\nMost of your bill is for financing the phones, which lots of times are 0 interest. If not, see if you can save money by paying them off. I assume that the devices are for 2 or more people.  Do you really need tablet Internet?  Between wifi and personal hotspot you could be covered (if carrier allows personal hot spot).\n\nPhones are obviously expensive, but I don't know what you could do now.  Next time check out other options and a \"bring your own phone\" plan.  For example, BLU has a 5.2 inch HD phone with 4GB of main memory and 64 gig of internal storage for $199.  No status, I know, but a pretty good phone. I pay $30 a month after taxes with ATT Go (pay as you go). Basically just paying for unlimited minutes, and texts. The jump from $177 to $212 \"after taxes\" is also after other fees charged. These are never quoted to you as part of the price. Things like paying for 911 service and other such things you would think are part of the deal. I don't really see a need for internet service.  If I wanted it then it's another $15 but I just use wifi when I have it. So say $45 a month is all you should pay. And cheaper still is out there. I highly suggest moving to a pay as you go plan type of deal and paying off the phones asap. Paying $200 a month for a phone bill is absurd, even including monthly payments for the devices. If I had an extra $150 a month to spend on phones I would be it towards debt or savings. I imagine you could use the same flexibility. You might be able to get free data for the tablets, not sure if TMobile is still doing that. For example my plan with 6 phones (2gb each) and 2 tablets (200mb) is $125 with T-Mobile. You should be able to pick up decent phones in the <$300 range. Most of the phones we have on our plan cost <$200.  Dude I was on the same boat your in.  I had T-Mobile and got fed up with the rising bill each and every month, was ridiculous. PLUS I was paying off a $650 Samsung Galaxy S7,crazy I know. I was on the Jump on demand program(where I can upgrade whenever I want up to 3x's/yr) so what I did was trade in my Galaxy S7 and purchased a cheaper phone and paid for it outright so I owned it.  Than I called T-Mobile and had to pull teeth but I got it, to unlock my new phone. With that being said I went to Cricket Wireless with their BYOD program and now I'm paying $30/month for unlimited talk/text and 1GB of LTE speeds. After that 1GB its just slower speeds(no big deal to me TBH) I'm saving so much more money now and the service in my area is not to shabby at all considering it's AT&T service.

Green Bays airport is smaller, but I've always found them reasonable, especially if you don't mind connection flights.  Any hobbies?  Any hobbies you want to pick up?  There will be quite a few places that will be similar in terms of COL and housing, but you should also think about how you want to spend your time at home, and how you want to spend your disposable income.  Before me and my wife had kids, we thought about moving to a lot of places, and it came down to a good COL and the activities we enjoyed, and I have a requirement for a decent airport.   There was some other stuff that happened, but San Antonio is where we are at now, and we love it.  Depending on where you are traveling and who you fly, that can be an issue with the flights here.  Housing is awesome here, tons of activities, and an awesome cultural mix.  like others said, no State Income Tax.  No NFL team here, but we have the Spurs and I think there is still an MLS team here.  Close enough to Austin if you wanna get in that mix too.  I live in the hill country just outside of town, and it's pretty great, as it seems we are far out in the country, but only 30 minutes to the airport, very rarely any lines at security.  Best of luck in your journey, think about the person you now get to become, and what kind of activities you would love to do. Several of the major airline hubs are reasonable.  Dallas isn't too bad and Texas doesn't have state income tax.  Salt Lake City is relatively cheap from what I understand.  Detroit is cheap and seems to be rebounding pretty well.\n\nIt depends how often you're okay with taking a connection and what kind of atmosphere you want to live in though.

I wouldn't leave just to leave. Maybe move to a new part of Atlanta to get a fresh start?

The $2000 or so per month portion that goes to our parents' loans would be difficult for them to pay. The remaining term on the loans at our current rate of payment ranges from about 5 years to about 20 years.\n\nWe currently rent, but we would like to buy a house or condo sometime in the next couple years. We live in an expensive area, so this will likely require a large (>$300k) mortgage. We currently have good credit (about 780), and hope to save a decent downpayment (between 10% and 20%). We have no other debt than the student loans.\n\nWe've recently been considering consolidating the medium-to-high interest rate loans, totaling about $110k, into a private loan from SoFi. They have quoted us a loan for that amount with a 7-year repayment term and a fixed rate of 3.75%, resulting in a payment of about $1600 per month.\n\nThis would rid our parents of a worry and a burden on their credit, save us $600 per month, and cut our worst-case remaining repayment term by two-thirds, but we're not how much it would affect our ability to buy a house.\n\nWhat do you think folks, should we move forward with the consolidation or should we wait?", "title": "Should we consolidate our personal and parent student loan debt?", "comments": "Given that you want to take over the student loan debt yourselves, the refinance to 3.75% seems like a no brainer.

A couple other thoughts.\n\n  * Put the extra $600 ($2200-1600) towards paying off the other 2 loans quickly.  Eliminating those debts quickly will decrease your DTI before you buy the house.  After those 2 loans are paid off, apply the $600/mo towards the down payment savings.\n  * Consider a longer than 7-year loan to reduce your required payment even further.  This would probably give you a higher interest rate but it might help you decrease your DTI if that's important for borrowing on a mortgage.  Doing this would also probably get you to pay off the other 2 loans even quicker.

My bill for January is once again over $200, and my heat is extremely low (60-63 in Massachusetts winter).  I work 50-60 hours a week so I'm not home all that frequently, though when I am I watch tv, have lights on, etc.  I live alone and don't feel I'm doing anything excessive so a $200 electric bill feels outrageous to me.\n\nCan anyone help me understand this bill?  Any suggestions?", "title": "Something is wrong with my electric bill...", "comments": "How many KWh are you using per day? Electric heat can be very expensive. Are they actual or estimated meter readings? That doesn't sound at all unreasonable for colder climate like Massachusetts if you have electric baseboard heat and it is an old place with not very good insulation and leaky (and/or single-pane) windows.  Depends also how large the place is.\n\nUnfortunately, electric heat is one of the most expensive types.  You should compare bills with your neighbors.\n\nYou should check windows and doors to see if they are letting cold air in / hot air out.  If it is an old place, there might not be much insulation in the walls and ceiling.\n\nMany utility companies will come to your place and do an energy evaluation for free.  You should check into that.\n\nOne way to reduce costs somewhat is to use the heat as little as possible and instead get one or more oil-filled electric space heaters and use them to warm only the room you're currently in, leaving the other rooms just warm enough that nothing freezes. Winter time is going to do that. Even though you do keep your heat set very low you are still trying to keep that temperature 30-60 degrees warmer than the outside air constantly! Different than in the summer when you barely used your window units to keep cool. And like others have said it is exponentially worse depending on the type of heat you have.  turn everything off and then go check your meter. if your meter is still running then something is definitely still pulling in power. also check your electricity bill and compare rates. electricity companies often charge more per kW during high usage seasons. What kind of electric heat do you have? Heat pump or resistance-based?\n\nAlso, how old is the building? It may be poorly insulated, or you might have bad weatherstripping at the windows and doors. There is good advice here (see: turning off all power while checking to see if the meter is still running). But frankly, especially with your 18% increase in electric prices, I'm not surprised by your high heating bill. I live in an all-electric apartment and electric heating is very inefficient/expensive. \n\nSome tips:\n\n* if your thermostat is programmable, drop it to 54 overnight (while you're in bed asleep) and while at work.\n\n* weather stripping for doors and windows\n\n* insulators for your windows\n\n* consider the benefits of adding gas to your all-electric home You can also call your utility company and get a ballpark of historical usage on a month by month basis. Then, compare that against the 6 months you've been there to figure out if you're in or out of line with the historical range.\n\nIf you're out of line, the next question is: \"Is something running that I don't know about or is my behavior the problem?\"\n\nI had to troubleshoot something similar myself recently. I just bought a place with an electric heat pump w/ a backup electric furance, and I'd never had that setup before.\n\nEverything I knew about saving energy was \"keep the temperature low at night and when you're away, and raise it to a comfortable level when you're home.\"\n\nThat doesn't work for my setup. A heat pump is extremely efficient, but it can't handle big temperature changes. So, by letting my house get super cold at night, it was causing the backup furnace to do all the work to bring the house up to a comfortable temp in the morning, and electric furnaces eat electricity like kid eating candy on halloween.\n\nI was freezing myself out all night and spending MORE money on electricity. Now I've learned to just pick the lowest comfortable temperature and leave it there around the clock because that's what a heat pump wants in order to run efficiently.\n\nSo... the type of heating system you have can have a tremendous effect on your bill because different systems require different set ups and different behaviors to run efficiently. Other than error, which occasionally happens you have two choices - usage and price.\n\nI see in your comments that your price is .09 and was .07. And I assume there is also a delivery component to the bill as well.  Is your current plan the variable rate plan or the fixed rate?  Most of MA has electric choice, so you can shop around for a cheaper rate.  I am guessing that you have Eversource -WMECO and the fixed rate plan, which has two periods,  Jan to June and July to Dec.  Looks like it took that distinct hop in January.  In that case, you can grab a six month .0789/kWh from Clearview or a three month .0839/kWh from Townsquare.  You have to become religious about these contracts, because the second they are up, the rates jack up.  If you time it right, you can hop in and out of a six month plan to avoid the January-Jun hop.  \n\nNext, usage.  Well, I'm betting on baseboard heat, which will eat you up.  However, go down the list of usual suspects.  Use a programmable thermostat, set it lower when you are away.  Change your bulbs to leds, see if you have any faulty appliances, shut things off at a switch or power strip -  you'd be surprised how much a cable box eats even on standby.  Weatherstrip, caulk, etc.  I don't know, offhand, if MA offers a free energy audit.  If they do, get it.  \n Do you have electric heat anywhere in the house?

Howdy.\n\nOk so first off, you need to read u/Chomper99 's comments.\n\nBut look lets talk about all this \"it should be torn down and burned and the ground salted so nothing ever lives here again\" mentality.\n\nI'm just over a month into a full gut/remodel of a house I bought with my parents for them to live in.\n\nThe previous owner lived there 40 years and it was marketed just as poorly as yours.  The whole \"you cant fix this.. just burn it and walk away\"... well, you can.  And if you know people in the industry you can do it for a reasonable rate.\n\nSo look you have 2 options.  Reach out to a carpenter/contractor and find out what it would cost to do a \"once over\" to get the place at least half decent looking.  Nothing big just spackle and some molding and at least someone can see \"hey this is a house\".  Couple hundred bucks.\n\nOr.. rehab it yourself and sell it.  This is where you have a contactor come in and they sub out the plumbing and electrical and drywall and painting and flooring.  You say you owe 45 but can sell for 20... I assume you have 15 to spend on it.  Spend the 15 where they tell you and sell it for 60.  You'll come out ahead.\n\nLots of options.  Yes, you can walk away and someone will get this at auction and turn it into a great house.  Or you can do it yourself (with contractors) and make a little money. 99.99% of houses are sellable, but the market will dictate at what price- that is, what an interested buyer is willing to pay you for it. You don't have details listed- how long have you been in the house? Has it been long enough to appreciate? What is the market like in your area?\nIf your local market has appreciated, you either paid too much when you initially bought it, or your listing price is too high for the current market. Ha I read ugly horse. \"Oh that's interesting didn't know you could shop for for horses on Zillow... Wait a minute.\" I've seen this scenario a few times locally.  Some naive owner buys a crappy house and thinks he/she can live there while working on it.  They end up ripping a lot of stuff out and stopping... sometimes compromising the structure of the house.  They just turned their turd into a deathtrap.  A lot of times the houses they choose are undesirable because of age, style, location, or something else they can't really change cheaply.  Eventually the gutted unfinished house gets put up for sale, investors don't want to step in somebody else's unfinished shit and the bank has to take it back. Join biggerpockets.com a site and forum for flippers and investors. Introduce yourself, post your house, explain your situation and see if anyone is interested in buying or working with you to flip it. \n\nIf you have been living in it for 4 years, it can't be that bad, someone will definitely buy it, again maybe not at a price you want, but you live and learn.  \"An\" investor wouldn't make an offer.\n\nSo what?\n\nThis doesn't mean that the house is unsellable. It just means that particular investor didn't want it. What is not working in the house? You've probably already thought of it but how about just cheapo-ing out on all the repairs so at least the pipes aren't leaking or anything. Look on Craigslist for a used furnace or something. Try used home appliance sales. It'll work out if you put the effort in I'm sure. An investor will buy the house...just not for the price you want/need. Sounds like the after-repair value is about 90k, repair costs are about 45-50k. An investor is going to want to make at least 20% profit on the deal. With a $35k asking price, they're looking at 8% max, and that's not even including holding costs. That's just not worth the risk. One misstep during the reno will totally kill any profit in the deal and turn this into a money loser for them.\n\nTalk to your bank about doing a short sale or just come up with the cash to cover a loss at closing because you need to lower your price by about 15-20k. Google your local REIA and go to one of their meetings. Usually they will have a time where people can market houses for sale. So you go to the front of the room, and keep it simple. \"I am a motivated seller with a house for sale. I think the Rehab cost might be 40k with an ARV (After repair value) 115k. If you are interested in checking it out give me a call at _______\" The more investors you get looking at it the more likely you will be to find one willing to buy it. They will probably tell you that your repair and ARV estimates are wrong, but that's ok. You just need to generate some interest so that you get some offers of what they think they actually WOULD be willing to buy it for. \n\nNew investors probably will not want to buy it because it is a large project. Experienced investors are more likely to. Also there may be some that can get creative on the way they buy it, such as buying it subject to the existing mortgage, that way you don't have to sell at a loss. If you have a mortgage, it can be really really hard to do anything with a house you can't sell. My personal experience is that was next to impossible to sell for less than I owed--the mortgage company wouldn't allow a sale for less plus a personal loan to make up the difference (meaning you'd have to find a back door into that solution). \n\nI ended up taking a foreclosure because doing it \"the right way\" (selling for 90k and I would pay the 20k difference myself) didn't work.  List it. Make sure local realtors know about it, most of them only see it on the RMLS because they don't want to deal with finicky FSBO's or simply they forget to check.\n\nMake sure it's priced at fair market value. Have your realtor call people they know. Reach out to people online.\n\nGood luck. I didn't read all of the comments so sorry if someone already said this - but maybe look for a wholesaler to sell your house to. They are middlemen between sellers and flippers (usually), and have more connections to investors.

I was pretty dumbfounded (why did he pick me up then? He knew my destination from the app), but I told him if he has to he should stop on the way.

I hopped out at the next red light, told him not to charge me, and got a cab instead. I missed my flight, and had to pay the $100 change fee. \n\n\nWhat REALLY annoyed me though is that he still charged me for the ride into Manhattan! SO I tried to contact Uber and explain what had happened, and requested that they a) refund the ride and b) offer compensation for the missed flight fee, since it was 100% their fault that I missed the flight.

I was on the way to catch a bus out of town as well and I demanded the driver stop and let me and my husband out if that was the case, as we did not have time, and would need to request another ride. \n\nThe driver insisted the app would just match him back with us, so I told him to let us out NOW so I could call a Lyft.

One option that nobody's mentioned so far (maybe that means it isn't a good idea...): you could try suing the driver in small claims court for the Uber fare + difference in price between Uber and the cab fare + $100 change fee + court costs.

I probably would've tried to leave the instant I notice he's driving towards Manhattan, before he gets on the bridge or Brooklyn Battery tunnel. LGA is basically in the other direction, and the gas stations are mostly (all?) on the far west side, 12th ave or so. Dispute the charges with your credit card company.  tell them what happened .  If your cc says it can't be done,  threaten them with cancelling your card, find another cc and tell them you want to transfer the balance .  I think they will back you up on this because most card companies want the business.  alternatively you could probably sue Uber in small claims court.  Your post really got me steamed .   I like Uber but this story is outrageous.  Good luck Drivers dont know where the next ride is going. Keep on working customer service, they basically always favor the customer.

Therefore, though they don't own the airline, they are responsible for the incidental expenses you incurred as a result of their failure to reasonably provide the service you contracted them for. \n\nAnd, oh yeah, I'll switch to Lyft and file in small claims if we can't get this fixed on this phone call.  I'm shocked Uber isn't refunding this. Maybe it's because I use Uber so much, but they always refund my ride or at least change the fare if I complain. I've even gotten $20 credits a few times. I disagree with an earlier poster about filing a chargeback unless you're never going to use Uber again. Once the chargeback is initiated and taken from Uber, they'll pass that on to you to repay.  Sounds like you got scammed.  Vegas has a similar thing that happens [link](https://insideflyer.com/2015/10/las-vegas-taxi-scams-dont-get-taken-for-a-ride/)\n    \nAsking for flight compensation might be a bit difficult, b/c they are not aware of your schedule.  So they can feign ignorance on that.  But you should keep pushing them for a refund on the uber fare.  If they're not responsive over email or phone, try tweeting at them.  Most companies now-a-days will take care of things quickly in the public arena.\n    \nIf nothing happens with that...do a charge back.  But be aware, by doing a charge back, they most likely will lock your account and you'll have to create another one or rely on a different company.\n    \nAs for the flight, talk with your CC company if they provide travel insurance.   Try reporting it to your credit card company (Visa/Mastercard/AMEX/Discover) they typically have the final say over any transaction that occurred.  I think its the B.) part that is causing this issue. If you had asked just for a refund of the trip, I think they would have probably obliged. However, by asking for compensation for the missed fight, you probably put them in a more defensive position. \n\nI would go back and ask for a refund just for the trip (that's what a charge-back would do anyways) and see what they say. Also a lot of credit cards have travel insurance, I would explore that option for reimbursement of missed flight.  Drivers can't see your destination until you're already in their car.  Uber doesn't control how much gas their drivers have. What you should have done was cancel the trip the moment the driver told you he was low on gas.

Is it better than being \"not vested\", what's the difference? And is it a GOOD thing to \"exercise\" them since I no longer work for the company? I'm assuming that's why they're asking me. What the hell even happens when I \"exercise\" the vested shares or stock options or whatever? Is it better to \"exercise\" or \"not exercise\"? Is there any reason I should \"not exercise\"? I was laid off from the company so I don't know what I'd want with their vested shares, whatever those are.", "title": "Got laid off and got e-mailed that I have 2500 vested shares and would I like to exercise. I have no idea what any of those words mean what do I do?", "comments": "Exercise in this context essentially means buy 2500 shares at $.61 per share. It would cost 1,525 to exercise this option. What is the company you worked for? It's important to figure out how much the current price is to see if it's a profitable trade.  \"Vested\" just means you can use the options (most rewards from the company are spread out over a few years).\nYour \"options\" literally mean you have the option to buy 2500 units of your company's stock at 0.61. \nSo the question is, is that a good price? If the current price of the stock is less than 0.61 then the options are worthless (normally called \"underwater\").\nIf the price is higher you can buy your 2500 options at 0.61. Then you have two choices - keep them and hope they grow in value, or sell immediately for the cash. For example, if the current price is 1.0 you would buy for 0.61 and sell for 1.0 making 0.39 per share. This is usually called a same-day sale.\nIn either case you would have to pay some tax on the money you make. How much depends on where you live and where the company is based.  You have the option to buy 2,500 shares of stock in the company at 0.61/share, because you were granted stock options (probably when you joined the company).  It is kinda interesting that you don't know this, because the purpose of stock options is that you hope the company will become successful and the company's stock will go up in value, and thus you will make a profit because it will be worth much more than 0.61/share (thus you can sell them in the stock market for a nice profit).  The goal is to incentivize you to stay at the company, and also to work hard to make the company successful.  Looks like it didn't achieve that goal in your case.\n\nIt will cost you .61 * 2500 = $1,525 to exercise them.  If you do, the company will then hand you 2,500 shares of stock (within a month or so).  You are free then to do what you want with them.  If this was a public company, you could turn around and immediately sell them in the stock market.  However, I see in one of your replies that this is private company.  Therefore, it is highly likely that you will not be able to sell them.  You will have to wait until the company goes public or is purchased by another public company.  This could be a long time, no way for us to know.  You could make a big profit if it happens.  But it may never happen, the company could go under and you would lose it all.  We can't judge how likely it is that your company will be successful someday.  This would be a gamble, and only you can judge if it is worth taking.\n\nTypically you have 90 days after leaving the company to exercise your options.  If you don't, the option goes away.\n\nIf you do exercise, but can't sell, there is a chance that you may owe income tax due to the purchase, even if you don't actually make a profit yet because you can't actually sell yet.  This is due to something annoying called the AMT tax, which someone can explain to you.  You may or may not be subject to that tax, it depends upon your individual tax situation.  I'm guessing that maybe your income isn't high enough for this to be an issue, but there's no way for us to know.  You would have to consult a tax professional.\n\nBottom line, you have to decide if you want to gamble $1,525 on the company you just left eventually becoming successful someday, possibly years in the future.  Only you can decide if you can afford it, and what the odds are.\n\nVesting is not something you need to worry about.  When you were granted those options, they don't allow you to exercise them right away.  They \"vest\" over time, meaning over time you are allowed to exercise more and more of them.  This is because the goal is to get you to stay at the company.  Since you left, your vesting has stopped, and whatever you are allowed to exercise is now fixed at 2,500 shares, period.  If you had stayed longer at the company, you probably could have exercised even more shares as time went by, but that's a moot point now.\n\n\n\n\n\n I'm genuinely curious what you did for this company if you don't know what your shares vesting and your ability exercise them means...  Stock options are a benefit given to you by the employer, and they vest over time to incentivize you to stick around. \n\nFor example: You are awarded 5000 options as a sign-on bonus when you take the job, with 500 shares **vesting** every month over 10 months. (This is an unlikely schedule, but it's easy to understand). Those options are given to you at the current company evaluation (in your case, you were given options valued at $0.61 per share).\n\nVested options are **exercisable** meaning you can purchase them at the valuation price. \n\nIf you choose to exercise them, you will have to pay 2500x0.61 which will net you 2500 stocks valued at $1,525.\n\nIf the company is publically traded on the stock exchange and the stock is valued higher than 0.61, then you will make the difference as taxable income. For example, if you company is traded at 1 USD then you already made 2500x1-1525=$975. **THIS IS A GROSS OVERSIMPLIFICATION.**\n\nSince your company is a small, private company, you have to decide if this is a good investment. \n\n* Do you ever see this company being sold? If so, will it sell at more than 0.61 per share?\n* Do you ever see this company going public? If so, will their stock be worth more than 0.61 per share?\n\nIf your answer to these questions is NO, then you should not buy the options.\n\nTalk to the finance person at your previous company and ask him if the company is seeking to be sold, and what is the current valuation for the stock.

We live in NJ and are trying to get the hell out of this state in 2018 and move somewhere more affordable. We just had our first baby in September 2016 and we live in a 1 bedroom apartment. We both own our own cars and have no car payments. We are lucky enough to both have healthcare through our employers that is affordable, however, our daughter is on my husband's plan and he has to pay 100% of her coverage. Neither of our jobs will let us add a dependent. That's roughly $600 off the top of his monthly income to cover her.

Is there some other category you have left off?  I would really focus on this first, since the easiest way to \"earn more\" is to cut expenses.\n\nIt sounds like you are going to have to set some priorities.  You know you are under-earning, but are determined to stick with your job because eventually you will get a job you like in your field for more money.  This is understandable, but it may mean you have to make some hard choices.\n\nDaycare is costing a bunch for only part time.  Where is your daughter the rest of the time?  If she is with you or your husband, can you stretch this out?  Can one of you work nights so the other can watch DD during the day?  This would eliminate the daycare bill.  Can you volunteer to watch a friend's kid on the weekend and have them watch her during the week?\n\nCan one of you pick up a second job on the weekends?  Even some stuff from the side gig section of craigslist can earn enough extra income to relieve the stress a bit.  Can you bus tables or bar tend, shovel snow or mow lawns.  Could you maybe clean houses and take DD with you?\n\nFor your taxes, the best way to figure this out is to buckle down and run the numbers both ways.  There are too many variables for a message board to really help with this.  But you should be able to draft all the forms for both situations and see how you come out the best.\n\nI know it will be tough.  You have a brand new kid and I'm asking you to essentially work 24/7 to earn more income.  But I honestly don't see how you are going to get in a better place without either cutting some bills or earning a bit more.

Then look at any other things, like Raises, bonuses etc, and use that as a weapon to free you from this debt.  Check on what the rates are on those loans, look at consolidation for a lower rate, stuff like that.   Look at your monthly bills...write them all out, and you'll be surprised at what things are costing you.  I made two calls yesterday to Directv and another to TimeWarner to tell them I was going to cancel in order to get a rate cut.  I saved 165 a month with that 30 minutes of my life.  And to the other point, don't put yourself in a terribly uncomfortable situation, but somewhere where you know you can treat yourself on occasion and feel good that you earned it, and not guilty that you've put yourself further behind. Definitely downgrade to a cheaper car payment. You have a high income, so paying off the debt in a few years is manageable if you play your cards right and live frugally.  Your situation is approaching dire, and you're going to need to commit to some long term lifestyle changes if you don't want to be penny-less in your retirement years. But at 29 there's still time. Our personal opinion of what we \"need\" to obtain an acceptable quality of life tends to have a habit of constantly creeping upwards. You're going to have to mentally reset that and learn to live simply again.\n\nSo here are my recommendations:\n\n1) Sell the car, buy a cheaper one in the range of $2-4k, use the extra money to pay off the car loan, which I'm guessing is likely your highest interest rate.\n\n2) Do you have any other high priced \"recreational\" assets? Motorcycle? Boat? High end theatre/stereo system? Mountain bike? Sell them.\n\n3) If you're paying $600/month off on a $50k debt, at 4% interest rate (my assumption) its going to take you a little over 8 years to pay off. My hunch is that you could probably pour more than that each month into paying off debt. A few years ago between my wife and I we were making about the same amount as you, and we managed to pay $1000/month to her student loans while still living comfortably, and you being single likely have much fewer expenses than a married couple does. If you bumped your debt repayment up to $1000, you'll be free and clear in 4.5 years.\n\n4) Create a budget for yourself, with a set amount of \"recreation\" money each month that you can spend guilt free, but don't spend more than that, ever. If you want a big ticket item like a vacation you have to save your \"rec\" money up.\n\n5) Plan to make these lifestyle changes for the long haul. If you don't get out of debt until your late 30's you'll be behind the 8 ball with saving for retirement, so you'll need to make an equally monumental effort to catch up with that. If you want a million dollars for retirement (basically the minimum you should be aiming for), and you don't start saving until you're 35, you're still gonna need to be putting $800-1200/mo away until 65. So effectively you'll be playing catch-up for the rest of your life.\n\nThe key is resetting your mental state and learning to be content living a simpler lifestyle. You can do it.

Had an entry-level marketing job, hired for entry-level marketing jobs before. If you don't mind me asking, why don't you think you could get an entry-level marketing job (which generally pays next to nothing, and makes you bottom-rung everywhere, even against other entry level jobs)?\n\nBased on your resume and location, you should be a shoo-in. What area of marketing did you see yourself starting in? I don't know the NY job market, but copy writing might not be a bad way to get a foot in the door. Do you have any digital design background or programming background? Sometimes that can help if you're working with website content. Familiar with any major CMS platforms like Wordpress? An internship or part-time job related to marketing would improve your chances of finding a job in that field.  \n\nYou should also work on your networking skills so you can impress at in-person networking events like on-campus job fairs or company info sessions.  Impressing recruiters in person is more likely to result in a job interview than applying for lots and lots of jobs online.  Recruiters will notice if you seem like a pleasant, confident person who asks good questions and expresses genuine interest in the company. \n\nIs there a reason you're primarily interested in marketing instead of something more closely related to economics, like finance or business analysis?

Instead we get IOUS, whenever \"corporate\" mails our manager a check to pay us. There is not specific date, we receive them randomly,  whenever. Everytime I ask hey wheres my money I need IOUS I'm told they don't have enough money to pay us, that they're waiting on a check. There is a cashbox in the office that is never supposed to drop below a certain point. Its usually almost empty most days. They say corporate says they wont send another check until blahblah day because they should have enough money in the store to pay us... But they don't.

I am told to declare, lets say $70 because after tip out that is what I made. So obviously any shift one works where they only make credit card tips is going to get this notification everytime!

Every check I get every two weeks is void because of taxes I assume. So the only income I make is through my tips. \n        Now I am freaking out, and wondering what is going on at this job! I don't know how, or if any these things relate to my W2 being WAY wrong? From my estimates its $12,000-15,000 over what I actually made! I need help in knowing who to talk to?

Looking at your information you are in a decent standing. First off $ 2000 is a healthy amount for a dog, we paid 1500 for a German shepherd, bred from decent lines. Best money I've ever spent. You will have some vet bills for his shots but nothing out of hand more along the lines of a few hundred or so, all depends on what the vet charges. Toys, bed, kennel, and training treats are all some pre puppy expenses. Neutering depends on the breed, I won't neuter my dog till he is a year old, so that isn't an upfront cost. I am not sure what your hours are but you may need to find puppy daycare to watch your dog during the week, unless you work from the apartment.  This was my last year for my two dogs:\n\nItem|Expected|Actual\n:-:|:-:|:-:\nDog Food|960|1359.38\nHealth/Meds|536|294.16\nMaintainance|110|214.08\nVet Visits|220|1625.17\nToys & Treats|420|583.60\n1 Time Purchases|N/A|235.64\nTotal|2246|4312.05\nMonthly|93.58|179.67\n\nA couple notes\n\n* One we've only owned for half the year\n* Combined they currently weigh about 90 pounds\n* We started them out on premium dog food, but later switched to more of a mid grade (definitely not budget brand)\n* I give them heartworm year round and flea and tick 8 months of the year\n* Maintenance is things like leashes, collars, pee spray, licenses\n* Puppies (especially mine) are idiots and constantly are trying to kill themselves. Much of those vet bills were from the two instances where one of them swallowed something they shouldn't have.\n* Each were spayed/neutered at about $250 each\n* I had most of their stuff before but I would guess we spent about $300 each on crate, dog beds, baby gates, stuff like that\n* Lastly, my wife spoils them and buys them too many toys and treats\n\nHope this helps.  I encourage you to adopt! I come from a family where we ALWAYS bought AKC dogs for multi-thousands of dollars (Maltese and husky breeds), and unfortunately many of them ended up with health issues. Since then we had volunteered at reputable shelters and we have two mixed breed dogs that we got very young (one as a puppy and one at about 1 year old). The bonding and training process was definitely easier with the puppy. But we have found both dogs to be SO much heartier and in better health than any of the purebred dogs we got from breeders in my youth. Plus, it feels so rewarding to take in an unloved/unwanted doggy, and you will pay SO much less money!\n\nAlso, don't forget to consider daycare or dog walking needs in your projected expenses. If you live in a city with a full time job, it's somewhat cruel (to the dog AND your neighbors who have to suffer the barking/crying) to leave the dog locked up all day for 8-10 hours (depending on the length of your commute). Someone needs to get the pup some exercise and let it relieve itself - multiple times a day when it's younger, or at least once a day during the work day after it's trained. It's also important to socialize the dog with other people and dogs (such as at a dog park) so it will be flexible and adaptable in a city environment. Also, if you travel frequently for work or vacations, find out about boarding costs in your area. For us that is the biggest dog expense we tend to have.\n\nAlso, consider what could happen if your roommate situation changes. Would you be able to find other accommodations that you can afford and that will allow the dog?\n\nAs far as hard costs go, we keep $2k on hand in case of a medical emergency (such as broken bone or emergency surgery). Before you get a dog, know where you will draw the line if the dog has a heartbreaking and expensive health issue (for example, we don't believe in putting a dog through chemo - both for the dog's quality of life and our own financial practicality beliefs). First year for puppy care can be closer to $1,000 - they are like little babies and can get ear infections or episodes of diarrhea that can cost more than you expect for exam/medication.\n\nFood cost can vary wildly. We have two 50-lb dogs and they go through a big bag of Blue Wilderness ($65/bag) each month. You can get food for half that price, but we find the grain-free, higher quality food keeps our dogs' coats shinier, teeth healthier, and overall energy and health much better.

This sucks.\n\n>  I also have about $28,000 in student debt, with interest rates between 3-6% (luckily only one loan is at 6%)\n\nDon't know the exact breakdown, but let's say it rounds to 5% interest. That works out to ~ $1,400 in interest a year. This amount is [tax deductible](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch04.html#en_US_2016_publink1000178272). So at your marginal tax rate of 15%, let's say you save $210 in savings from taxes (0.15 * 1400), and you're really out $1,190 (1400 - 210).\n\nAs others have mentioned, you're in a low tax bracket (10-15%), but that is still worth some savings. I don't know what your expenses are, but if you contributed the full 18k for tax deferral, that'd save you $1800 to $2700, which is more than you'd pay for your loans. You'd also get an additional $18k in retirement savings that you can't catch up if you change your mind later on.\n\nDoes your 401k have a Roth option? If so, I'd actually skip the tax savings and contribute Roth because of your low bracket. You're 22 years old, so it'll have a ton of time for tax-free growth that'll wipe out the small interest you're paying on the student loan.\n\nIf you don't have a roth 401k option. I'd still contribute to a Roth IRA before paying down the loan. Again, same reason as above.\n\n**tl;dr** I don't think 3-6% is unreasonably high interest rate to rush and pay off. I'd contribute more to get the tax savings. Personally, I wouldn't sacrifice retirement contributions to pay more than the minimum payments on your debt.\n\nThe amount you stand to gain from decades of compounding and tax-free growth in your retirement accounts will likely vastly outweigh the extra interest you pay on the debt now.

It's in an okay neighborhood, near downtown, though there's nothing really in our downtown. We live in a medium size city, but rent is expensive here because we have the headquarters for a multi-billion dollar chemical company. A lot of the renters are from outside the US. To rent a house that is in nice (usually newer or remodeled) condition, in a nice neighborhood, with a garage, yard, and 3+ bedrooms, and at least 1.5 bathrooms is no less than $1,200/month. [Company] People, as we call them, rent those because [Company] pays their rent. That's way out of our price range. Like...in our next life sort of price range. Up to $750 is doable for us. Anything more and we can do it, but I don't feel so good about it.\n\nThis house that we looked at is older. About 1100 sqft. Has 3 bedroom, basement, a considerably small kitchen, but a nice sized dining room. There's enough space for us (2 adults, 3 kids). I would definitely say that it's worth $700 a month. Money is tight, so that extra $25/month can do a lot. \n\nNormally, I wouldn't even consider negotiating that last $25, but we know that's it's been sitting empty since at least end of September 2016. One reason we believe no one is renting it is because of the area. It's really not a horrible area. There is a school very close and a lot of kids, but it's on a corner lot with virtually no yard. \n\nIs it even possible to negotiate rent? Is it worth it for that last $25? It is through a re/MAX office. I don't want them to be insulted, but if it's been sitting empty and we're the only serious inquiry in months (according to neighbors) then maybe it's not so far fetched?\n\nEDIT: We did get the house. I originally asked for them to come down to $680. There's a lot of work that needs to be done and we don't mind doing the work if they reimburse the supplies. I found out it's a lady who's about 85 years old that is the owner and her son usually does the work in between renters. It shows. It is run by a small management company. They did have someone come and fix the toilet, but when a branch from the neighbor's dead ash tree fell on on the roof, the son came out to take care of it. It's a very old house that was in a fire at some point. You can see the floor joists in the basement. The hardwood floor, we've figured out, is really just old subfloor that someone pulled the carpet up from a LONG time ago and \"refinished\" with wood glue to fill in the cracks. I hate and love this house. I hate it because it's a shitty house that we can make livable. I love it because it's not bad like the situation we were already in at my father's house. That was really bad. They did come down to $700/month, but said that the next year it will go to $725. I'm not sure if we'll try to find something else for next year. We probably will. If they ever try to sell that house they will have a very hard time. The floors are tilting in all different directions, the ductwork is shit - the dining room, living room, and 1st floor bedroom are hotter than Hades while the upstairs, kitchen, and bathroom (which is off the kitchen) are freezing. The bathroom is the worst with only a 7\"x2\" vent at the bottom of the wall and the floor tilts away from the house, so if you aren't careful you can fall IN to the bathroom. \n\nIt's overall a shitty house, but it's what we could find and we had to get out of where we were.

If they are looking for a year, and you are cool with longer, I'd offer 2 years for 675 a month.  It can't hurt to ask.

You're not going to lose this apartment if they deny your request and simply offer it to the next person in line, it doesn't sound like there's anyone in line!\n\nThe worst that can happen is they come back with \"no\", and then you decide if you want to move forward at $725. You can always negotiate. The worst that can happen is they say \"No\".\n\nThink about how you'll do it though. If you just ask if they are willing to rent it for less money they are likely to assume that if they say \"No\" you'll take the higher rent. But if you explain that you would really like to move in and would even be willing to sign for an extended lease but that you can't afford $725 they may realize that they have a choice between renting it to you at a lower price or waiting around.\n\nConsider that each month that this place is not rented they get nothing at all. So if the choice is between renting it to you for $700 now or to someone else for $725 a month from now, that person will have to stay for over 2 years (29 months) to cover that one month of lost rent. A corporate owned property that uses algorithms to determine market value is usually hard to get them to budge.

It's not like buying a car from a dealership, where there's some 'true' underlying price that they're marking up from. So many things go into the price of health care that even hospitals are kind of guessing.\n\nHospitals, because they're obligated to provide care, are at special risk of giving services  to people who can't pay. So they tend to inflate _all_ of their prices so that the bills that get paid make up for those that don't. This mostly impacts insurance companies, but it does mean that people like you get caught with big coinsurance payments. So for that reason, they have wiggle room on your out-of-pocket costs.\n\nTo be fair, they're probably not ready to haggle all day like a car salesman, so don't think you're going to go back-and-forth a bunch.

Your marginal tax rate is going to be somewhere in the 20-percents. Some quick sketchy math: getting 10k would happen if you were able to deduct an extra 50k from your taxes. Instead, you're deducting mostly 3k worth of interest.\n\n- The marriage penalty means you don't get help if you both make roughly similar amounts of money. If one of you weren't working, it would be different.\n\n- I assume this is with itemizing deductions. Have you computed it with the standard deduction?\n\n- If you're itemizing, did you also include the property tax on the house? Married filing separately will be worse.  If you owe $155, that's pretty good.\n\nThe problem with the tax benefits of marriage is that the \"common knowledge\" is wrong; the benefit only really kicks in when only one of you is working, or one of you has a low income.  If you are both decent earners, your taxes are more likely to *increase*, as you can land in higher brackets.\n\nThat happened to my wife and I, too.

Just reality. You can get it removed after you've hit 20% of principle. You can but I would not recommend it. \n\nI'd make as big of a down payment as you can and then keep paying extra on the principal until it falls off.  Yes, you can sometimes get secondary loans. I'm not very familiar with these, so I can't speak to it\n\nSome banks/credit unions will offer special financing programs for first time homebuyers that only require 10% down and don't require PMI. I'd search high and low for one of these first.  Some banks (not all) allow you to do 80/10/10, which lets you take out a second loan (piggyback loan) instead of PMI, though that 2nd loan has a higher rate than the first.\n\nI'd look around for any programs your city/county/state might offer - the county I'm in has one where first time buyers only have to put I think 5% down and no PMI if they're below a certain salary. \n\nCheck with a local mortgage lender, they're pretty good about knowing things that'll save you a bit of cash.

Couple times a year he goes for checkups it's $300-$500.  Want to go away and put him in a kennel, it's $30-$40/night.\n\nIt adds up. Remember to include the cost of yearly vet visit/vaccines/tests.  That's in the range of $200 - $400/year.  One our cats has medical issues and it's much higher.  You have no ability to predict which cat will be medically needy when you pick one out.  Also, when they get older, expenses for medical needs are much higher. I think you need minimum 1k cat emergency fund for, well, emergencies. . . Because they happen. Mine is worth every penny and then some but he is NOT cheap. We have four (don't ask) and it's probably about $125 all in.  I don't buy scooping litter tho, we have a bunch of boxes but they all prefer one in particular so I just dump it every few days.\n\nThat said, my cats are just the best - sweet, smart, funny.  They're mutts but somehow I lucked up... they have almost none of the negative stereotypical behavior of cats, they're always following me around and lying in my lap and wanting to play.  Love them dearly. If you get a cat as a gift and it's already got all it's shots, litterbox and stuff it's cheaper. Then it really depends on the type of cat, it could eat a lot more and use the litter box a lot more that other cats. It also might be super picky about food and litter, which means you spend even more trying to please it so it doesn't go to the bathroom around your house. Then you'll need to clean up your house and get supplies for the inevitable. \nI'd budget $40 to $90 a month for a cat, on the upper side if you have to make doctor visits at any time or it's older or a kitten. If its a new kitten expect to spend a lot more $40-$250 a month for the first year for all it's shots, flea stuff, spay/neuter, treats, toys and furniture and house supplies. We typically spent around $30 per month on ours.  Kibbles and litter are cheap.  \n\nWe're spending around $50 per month now, since our cat is now on a wet-food only diet. I budget $45/month for two cats, but haven't had two long enough to see where this will end up.  You can get them fixed for cheap through a lot of places (one of ours ended up being $85 but that was with extra vaccines, flea meds, a microchip).  Month to month litter and food is probably around $45 for two cats.  You'll have some upfront costs like a litterbox and a scratching post (don't skip out and get a tall one).  We also got a water bowl with flowing water for under $50.  They still like drinking out of the toilet/bathtub, but they do enjoy the running water, heh.  \n\nCollars, microchip, shots, adoption fee, spay will all run you a small chunk of money but won't be permanent.  You might want to think about paying for petcare when you travel (family/friends are cheapest option, neighborhood teen will run you $10 a day).  \n\nOh and they've broken 15+glasses in the last few years.  So there's that.  Totally worth it:) My 2 cats for one month:\nwet food $25\nDry food $17\npet rent $20\nkitty litter $28\ntreats and misc $10\nso total about $100/month\n\noccasional nail trim / ear cleaning is about $30 / each at the vet\n\nI have always fed them very high quality food and kept them out of kennels to avoid picking up illness from other animals and they have been very healthy for 15+ years now. So I have been lucky to have had very few trips to the vet.\n I have two cats- I adopted them when they were 3 months from the local rescue for $10 each.  They still needed some shots when I got them, so a couple hundred to start with there.  I took them in a couple weeks ago for their 1 year boosters on 3 shots, plus a prescription of ear drops (for ear mites), it was just about $250.  I spend about $60 on dry and wet food plus litter delivered every 8 weeks from Chewy, so $30/month for both of them. \n\nPlus 5 bucks for a laser pointer.  Mandatory.\n\nThe nice thing about cats is that they're fairly self-sufficient.  I have a cat tower by the window because my parents got me one for Christmas, but they're happy to lounge around on the couch/bed/floor/kitchen table/windowsill.  They're totally cool with a big bowl of kibble for a couple days if I go out of town, or a friend stopping by every day or two for longer trips. \n\nAlso, I highly recommend two.  They play with each other and stay out of trouble instead of wrecking my things, usually.  Plus they're adorable when they curl each other.  I'm a relatively new cat owner with a Bengal, she's 7 months old and I've had her since November. So far:\n\n\nFood - $35 per month\n\nLitter - $19 per bag delivered from chewy, lasts about 1.5 months\n\nVet - $150 for 6 months exam and shots, $325 for spay and a shot\n\n\nThen there's misc expenses like toys, cat wipes for when she had a cone on and couldn't clean herself, surgical suit because she kept pulling the damn cone off, etc. I got a hand-me-down cat tree and I clip her nails myself, so I did save a bit there.  I have two 2 year old Siamese cats I adopted last June. I spend $11.25 a month for a 7lb bag of Purina One cat food, $36.81 for 3 boxes of 28lb Arm and Hammer litter (the best litter I've ever had in masking the smell), and $50 for annual shots per cat at my military vet clinic on post (Fort Hood). I get the food and litter off of Amazon Prime and have it delivered to me. Saves time and money. Subscribed to the food and it saves me another couple bucks. I wish there was a subscription to the litter but it's still cheaper than stores. \n\nThe previous owner really helped out with 90% of the initial expenses by including everything (e.g. 2 cat towers, 3 top lid litter boxes, bowls, toys, leashes, brush, scratch pads, cats came microchipped) with the cats for $175. I have friends check on the cats by paying them with beer or checking on their pets when they're out of town. \n\nI've left the cats at home for 5 days with no issues over the holidays by filling up extra bowls of water and food using my own bowls and setting out all 3 litter boxes. Each litter box is filled with one 28lb box of Arm and Hammer litter. I use 2 litter boxes when we are home and top off each litter box with the 3rd litter when it starts smelling. I change out the entire litter every 6-8 weeks. Litter clumps are cleaned regularly (every 2-3 days). \n\nNeighbors, friends, and family will save you a lot of pet hotel fees if you ask them to take care of your cat while you're away. Just offer the same or repay them with some money, food, beer, whatever works for you. \n\nMy cats only sleep in the cat tower or on the floor despite having a cat bed. I've never had anything broken by them which is weird because my former cats always knocked things over. My boyfriend recently bought an undercoat/deshedder brush for $20 also from Amazon. I don't spend much on the cats at all. Catnip, toys, and scratch pads can all be found on Amazon for cheap. \n\nAs far as medical goes, I don't have cat insurance because I think they are ok without it plus I don't want to spend more than I really need to especially since they get a quick check up from annual shots anyway. \n\nAmazon, thrift stores, Craigslist giveaways and whatever other resource you can imagine probably already has these things for you. Just look around. I hope this helps. \n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention that Petco or your local pet store usually has promotions with discounted vaccinations for $50-$75. Doesn't get to ask the stores when they'll have their next promo event. We have two cats and second about $50/ month on them. I buy good quality dry food and regular wet food. I splurged on an automated self washing litter box called the Catgenie 120 and LOVE it. It scoops, washes, sanitizes and dries the reusable litter pellets. There is no smell and the litter refills and sanitizing cartridges cost around $20/ month. They haven't needed many vet visits, maybe a total of 4-500/yr.  Oh, I forgot to say don't forget \"pet rent\" if you live in an apartment. Where I live it is quite common to have an extra $20/month rent plus an extra pet deposit.  food, vet, cat litter. toys. treats...less than $75/month for sure I have an elderly cat with kidney disease. Kidney disease is incredibly common in older cats, so if you plan to keep the cat for its life (which you absolutely should!) you should keep costs like mine in mind. Her treatments include: sub-q fluids ($27/month), checkup + blood test ($180/6months), and prescription food ($43/3months).\n\nOther than that she is very cheap. Litter is like $20 a month, depending on what type you prefer. I do not allow her outside so we skip the flea/HW/vaccines but many people opt for them just in case. Depends on where you get the cat how healthy it's family genes are. Which will lessen chance of vet visits. If you get from a well known breeder who has them fixed with shots as well as a few generations of healthy domestic cats born would be a better bet than getting a kitten from Craigslist who's mother got pregnant from your local alley cat. Good food will prevent some potential issues which can lead to vets visits from cheaper foods. Other wise it just really depends you never know but one thing's for sure if something health wise go wrong it can be a very steep bill.

Not carrying a balance is very important, carrying any balance causes interest to accrue and it costs you money. However, a huge part of your score is the balance reported, and it's different than carrying a balance. The bank will report the number on your statement every month as the balance, if you pay that number by the due date they don't charge interest and you don't \"carry a balance\". However, it does still show on your credit report, and that number divided by your total credit limit should be low, but not zero.\n\nBasically, it means use your credit card, don't max it out, and always pay it off completely every month. For the most part that looks like carrying a balance on your credit report, and that's good, also maxing the credit card is bad (and for this reason it's usually better to focus on boosting your limit while paying it off completely every month, because they look at the ratio, not the raw value). Unrelated to the actual question, but general advice on credit cards, if you can get a card that follows SCRA benefits even if it was opened after joining I would get that instead of the MilStar card, for example Capital One. Though if you want to use the MilStar card for the discounts on gas and the food places on base it also could be worth it. Get a starter card from usaa or navy fed.  Avoid mil star cards.  Fun fact if you miss a payment they will send mail to your commander.  I used to have to deliver the letters about 2 or 3 a month.  Anyway when I was starting out in the army I got a secured usaa card, and put my phone and internet bills on it.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* SS is a flat percentage. And then even tops out at after you've earned 127k for a given year. \n\nFederal income tax uses brackets, the more you earn, the greater percentage you pay. \n\nSo someone earning say 25k a year will have a marginal tax bracket of 15% and probably pay an effective rate of something like 10 to 12%. \n\nSomeone earning 350k a year will have a marginal tax bracket of 33% and probably pay an effective tax of around 28%. \n\n SS/Medicare are not progressive.  Federal income taxes are.  Also, you won't be paying any federal tax on the first X thousand of income (depends on family status).  So the effective rate of federal taxes changes from 0% to perhaps 20% or so as your income increases.  The SS/Medicare effective rates are fixed for lower incomes, and then slowly decrease as your income increases.\n\nShorter answer: this is normal. There is a max on which you reach which doesn't really hit in your scenarios but is why the FICA maybe less in an adjusted case 2. \n\nI forget but I think it's 127K\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc751.html\n The tax isn't higher; the *withholding* is higher.  At the end of the year your tax return computes what your actual taxes should be and you get refunded any amounts withheld that were too high.\n\nWithholding is always a lot higher for unexpected jumps in income like bonuses or periods with high commission.  They have to withhold (by law) as if you earn that same amount of money all year even if they know you don't/won't.  Then you get some of it back at tax time.

I generally eat rice, inexpensive chicken breast, potatoes, etc and I don't EVER eat out or get fast food. This wouldn't be much of a problem as is and could even be considered healthy, but I will often times go without meals if I forget to bring my own food to school out of fear of spending money.

When trying to seek help on the internet, I cant seem to find anyone with a similar problem, as it seems that most individuals have the opposite issue.

Once you are out of college and have a steady income, then you will likely feel better spending money.\n\nOne thing that may help you with your anxiety is to write out a budget that has money for food every week, and then you can feel confident getting food and maybe even treating yourself every once in a while without feeling like it's your last dime. Most people don't budget out of fear, and end up overspending because of it.  You underspend because of the same fear.\n\nSo make a budget, and include as part of your budget \"fun money.\"  It can be something as small as 1% of your income. Even 5% or 10% should be no big deal and still allow you to save.  Regardless, if you have your money budgeted so you know where it's going and that you ARE saving money every month, then you will feel a lot better about being able to spend your \"fun money slush fund.\"\n\nYou're mortal and although it's extremely unlikely you'll die anytime soon, the reality is that any one of us could die on any random day.  You don't want to be 80 years old and living penniless on the streets, but you don't get bonus points for dying with a huge bank account either. Have you set financial goals for yourself? Save $X for a house down payment. $X for a wedding. $X for trip to Europe... Once you have goals, it makes it easier to move forward. It sounds like you're saving money for no particular reason right now so it's hard to part with it because \"is it really worth it\" will always cross your mind.\n\nBeing too frugal isn't always a bad thing. Is it negatively impacting your life? If you're reaching the point where you're just starving yourself to save yourself a couple dollars, then maybe you need to rethink how you're allocating money.\n\nSet some financial goals and develop a budget for yourself. That way, if you're under budget that month (after fulfilling monthly goals of saving for particular things), you can view it as \"fun money\". Look into making a budget with minimums and maximums. It helped me spend a bit more than I used to.  Try reading [\"Mind Over Money\" by Ted and Brad Klontz](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B002WA4O9E/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1). It's really good for figuring out how you got your money habits, and how to get past them. It was really enlightening my first time through. Also, it's written in a way that's easy to digest. Try searching on Poverty Consciousness. Some videos on YouTube about this and the \"curse of the middle class\" on YouTube under the The Fearless Man. \n\nIt is effectively a fear, likely stemming from early childhood experiences or learned behavior from your family. For example, my grand parents grew up dirt poor in the depression and to this day the idea of eating everything on my plate sticks with me no matter how full I am. It's a behavior I leaned and worked to unlearn. Some are more deeply rooted in fear and this where topics like \"releasing\" or \"allowing\" come in. \n\nI would like to acknowledge you for actually reaching out about this. I suggest some journaling of your thoughts and feelings on this when it comes up. Also suggest looking for other areas where the same underlying behaviors are at play.  I totally understand where you're coming from. I'm quite similar to you in respect to money. I'm 20, in university with 30k saved up and I spend on the necessities only. My grocery bill is quite small, and my family and friends generally say that I have an issue and should spend on myself a lot more and enjoy life. One thing I could tell you especially in regards to food would be to allow to treat yourself once in a while. I really hate to buy expensive food especially if it's not necessary like desserts. But once every 3 months or so I might buy myself a bag of donuts if they are on sale or something. I also tend to not mind the spending as much especially if it's for a good thats much healthier then what I used to buy. In terms of general living I've heard of a lot of people putting aside X amount of money per month as a spend on yourself fund. That way you don't really feel bad when spending it since it's already sort of accounted for. Hope this helps. It's all about perspective though, I feel like I'm happy with the amount of money I spend on myself, regardless of other people's thoughts etc. If you feel like you're not enjoying it enough then perhaps try to spend a bit more on activities, things you like, events etc. But if you feel your not spending enough because people are telling you you aren't then don't sweat it! Have you considered travelling a little? If you have the money and time, might as well treat yourself. Most kids our age don't have the means to do it without setting themselves back with debt. I like to give myself a \"Treat Yo'self\" budget every month. Something like $100-200 that I spend on me and me alone. That can either be a nice dinner with friends, a new shirt, a random gizmo, whatever I want at the time. It makes a huge difference! This doesn't sound unhealthy to me at all.\n\nI'm the same way, and I have $221,000 in my investment accounts.\nThe goal is to keep living cheaply for a few more years, and every year returns from my investments cover a greater and greater percentage of my cost of living.\n\nEventually it's all covered, at which point I can quit my day job and work on my own projects full time.\n\nMoney gives you freedom.

I do have a couple college educations to pay for but I have that covered thru pre-paid tuition and 529 etc...\n\n  Speaking with my financial adviser, he states I should look into an umbrella policy (in general).  I was wondering if having my home paid creates any additional risk to my financial well being.  ", "title": "Does owning a home outright have more risk now that the bank has no interest?", "comments": "You should have an umbrella policy anyway, regardless of if your house is paid off or not.\n\nNo, paying off your house does not have additional risk tied to it. Nope, not in any significant sense now; your exposure to random house-related lawsuits is the same as it always was, with the caveat that now if something happened to crater your house's value, you wouldn't gain anything by walking away.\n\nYou definitely want an umbrella policy, but that's true of pretty much all homeowners. Having a paid for home shouldn't increase your potential liability in terms of being sued.  Well, it technically could if you were very visible and someone targeted you to try and sue you...say you owned a $1 million home free and clear versus owning a $1 million dollar home with a $950K mortgage on it but no addt'l cash in the bank...but they'd have to really look into your info thru a title insurance company to figure that out so they'd have to be pretty conniving...then once they figured out you had a ton of equity in that house they could go slip on your steps and fall off the porch...but the % chance of running into that type of person/scheme is really small.\n\nBut having bunches of fancy, visible stuff (houses, boats, etc) makes you more visible which could possibly make you more of a \"sue him/her\" target.  Example being someone like Dave Ramsey versus some unknown person...Dave is well known radio personality that talks about his finances / wealth, so everyone knows he's well off and doesn't have any debt either.\n\nEither way though, visible or not, if you have a decent net worth you should get an umbrella liability policy.  Typically you'd get it from the same company you have your home and auto insurance with so that it meshes together smoothly.  Your insurance agent would make sure that your underlying policies (home, auto, boat, etc) had the proper minimum amounts of liability insurance on them so that the umbrella picked up exactly where they ended.\n\nOur $5MM umbrella policy only costs something like $900/year if I recall.

You need to determine what your SO expects from the ring. Some would not accept anything other than a diamond. Some want one big stone while others are OK with one or more small stones.\n\nWays to save money:\n\nBuy a used ring from https://www.idonowidont.com/ or a similar site\n\nBuy a moissanite stone instead of diamond\n\nBuy the stone online (bluenile for example) and have it set in a ring locally\n\nBuy a ring from Costco. Bonus: you can return it if needed. Find a girl who would rather use that sweet sweet ring money as a down payment on a new home. Do what you can, but do not sacrifice your emergency fund.  If that means you have to wait, then wait.\n\nBigger bling will come in time.  Do not start your financial life together in debt. Does she expect an expensive ring?\n\nYou can probably find a ring for less than $1000 that is awesome if you look around. Multiple small stones in a pattern looks great instead of one big stone that sticks out and snags on sweaters. Consider stones other than diamond.\n\nSome women prefer a guy with financial sense over stupid romantic overspending. You don't get a ring that will kill you. If you guys are in love,  a ring is garbage in comparison. Love with your heart, use your head for everything else.  Ask a family relative for an heirloom.\n\nor get a reasonable ring 1-2K. (Used Rings are cheap and generally perfectly fine.)\n\nA girl who can't appreciate your best effort or share your personal finance standards is one that will not remain your wife in the long run.  Talk to your SO about the ring and ask her what she wants you to spend on it. Often times the receiver of the ring expects you to shell out a lot less than you think you should. It was a marketing tactic to get people to do \"surprise proposals\" so that diamond sellers could remove the more modest half of the couple from the ring discussion and make more $$.\n\nAlso, while a diamond ring and fancy wedding may be culturally buried in our conscience, don't be afraid to buck the trend with a less expensive ring (try other gems too, there are more than just diamonds) and a small family wedding. The money saved could go towards buying a home together or an investment fund. Not as sexy (depending on who you talk to), but far more practical. Then again, if the wedding and ring are important to you, then do you. Like travel, weddings are experiences, and many people are willing to pay a lot for one just so they have that wonderful memory forever. Talk to your girlfriend about moissanite. Is she open to the idea of something other than a diamond?\n\nI'm about to sound like some kind of moissanite cult evangelist, but I will never stop singing the praises of moissanite. My engagement ring is moissanite. I LOVE IT and I still believe it was a smart decision.\n\n1. It's cheaper than a diamond. Like waaaayyyyy cheaper.\n\n2. It's more ethical than a diamond because it's made in a lab - you don't have to worry about accidentally purchasing a conflict diamond (because apparently you can't really be sure, that \"certification\" from the jeweler doesn't actually mean much).\n\n3. It's better for the environment because it doesn't have to be mined out of the ground.\n\n4. It's a 9.5 on the Mohs scale of hardness, so it's basically just as durable as a diamond. It will not scratch or get cloudy with wear and tear (unlike white sapphire or cubic zirconia).\n\n5. It's super sparkly and it won't have any \"inclusions\" that you'll get in a cheaper diamond.\n\n6. Like 99.9% of people will just assume it's a diamond anyway. (However this does not mean you spring this on your girlfriend without telling her, you guys BOTH need to be on the moissanite train.)\n\nMy husband purchased my ring from MoissaniteCo online for $400 and it is absolutely perfect! I've been wearing it every day for 2 years and it still looks fabulous. Right before the wedding, I took it to a jeweler to have it cleaned and replated, and at first the jeweler didn't notice it was not a diamond. He guessed it was worth about $4000. I told him it was moissanite and he ended up appraising it at $1200 (NOTE: appraisal value is NOT market value, but I do think it's an interesting fun fact that we paid 1/3rd of that).\n\nTL;DR: ask your girlfriend about her feelings on moissanite! To add a side note to all the financial advice...think outside of a diamond. Seriously. This is my engagement ring. I love it. It's different. Did not cost an arm and leg and the damn thing is huge.\nhttps://www.helzberg.com/product/ring+2122955.do?sortby=bestSellers&catId=5084&from=fn\n\n Buy a ring for under 3k so you don't spend all your emergency fund but can still get her a decent ring. My husband spent 2.7k on my ring set(white gold with one carat diamond and a plain small white gold ring) and it is perfect(I actually thought he spent too much I would have been happy with a $100 ring!) remember after you get engaged comes wedding cost and a honeymoon if you want one so don't blow your whole budget just on a ring! We only spent a little over 3k on our wedding though because we wanted a home after the wedding. We did the honeymoon on our 2 year anniversary which was awesome! Option One: Wait and save up more\n\nOption Two: Buy a cheaper ring\n\nMy husband had $2k set aside for my ring, ended up spending $600 and it was perfect.   My SO and I bought the ring for about $1,100. That includes the band and the ring. His ring was passed on from his grandfather. We got married in Oct 2016. The one thing I wish we could have spent more money on was the photographer. Don't let the ring blind you with wedding costs.  Get a cheep place holder to propose, then go shopping with your girlfriend.   [deleted] Don't spend a ton of money on a ring.  You're doing well financially and as much as guys think the more they spend on a ring, the happier the girl, the better the marriage, it really doesn't matter.  If it's too expensive, she'll be afraid of wearing it because something may happen to it.  You'll notice all the appraisals for jewelry are full of shit.  If you try to pawn or resell it later, you'll get a tiny fraction of what you paid.  Not saying you will, but don't think about it as a transfer of value.  If she leaves you because you buy a cheaper or less fancy ring, it'll be the best money you've ever spent.  If she loves you, a piece of wire and a promise should be enough.  There's plenty of couples out there that don't have 5k in the bank account, just be reasonable with how you spend it. This sub loves to hate on engagement rings, but the truth is you shouldn't take relationship advice from strangers on the internet (for the most part.) And that is exactly what this is. Relationship advice.\n\nYou should find out your girlfriend's expectations. What does she want/expect? She might have been dreaming about the perfect diamond ring since she was a little girl. Is that stupid? To me? Yes. And it is also probably stupid to you. However, just because your girlfriend wants a nice diamond ring does not mean that she is a horrible, money-grubbing person.\n\nLook, diamonds are overpriced. We all know that. I bought my wife a nice diamond (at least to me). I spent around 6k on it. That was about 1 and 1/2 month's salary for me at the time. I know that she would have been happy with a less expensive ring, and I certainly could have spent a significant amount more. However, I know that she wanted a nice ring that she would be proud of and want to show off. I think I accomplished that.\n\nI plan on being married for many, many years, and in the grand scheme of a marriage 6k is not that much. Does it mean that we will have a perfect and successful marriage that lasts for 50 years? No. But it also doesn't mean that our marriage will be a failure because I didn't buy her a $200 ring at a pawn shop.\n\nThe bottom line is that you need to talk to your girlfriend about her wants/expectations. Not some strangers on the internet. By the way, I'm also a stranger on the internet so view my advice in the same vein.\n\nEdit: For what it's worth. I bought the ring at a retailer that offered no interest financing for a year. I put down 2k, and figured out how much I had to pay per month to pay it off in 11 months. Then, I paid that amount every month, and paid off the ring in 11 months with no interest. I wish I would have had the money to pay it all off at the start, but I didn't. Save up and buy it when you can afford it. I was going to write way too much on this but---here's my advice. \n\nEither take her shopping with you so she really does get to choose what she loves, or go ask WeddingBee.com ring forums. Those women know gemstones inside, outside, upside down and can tell you to the 1/8th carat weight where to get the best diamond/moissanite/gemstone ring. What online places are the best, etc. I won't even pretend I know half as much as they do.  One of the suggestions we usually offer when the ring question comes up, is, do you have a family ring from your mother or grandmother with history and sentimental value?\n\nThere's a post on /r/legaladvice right now from a guy whose ex-fiancee threatened to sue him because when she went to sell the ring because it was moissanite and worth about $100.  I knew some friends who bought gorgeous engagement rings for <$1000. Don't destroy your finances over such a material luxury as an engagement ring. Probably the best comment here. Thank you.  I bought an inexpensive ring with a small diamond.  I think I spent around $200 for the set.  For our 10 year anniversary I bought a decent sized diamond and replace the stone that was in the original ring.  I also had some other cosmetic things changed on the ring.  You shouldn't spend thousands on a ring. Buy used.  Seriously.  Meet up at a jeweler of your choice that will authenticate the ring, and you'll avoid getting raked over the coals.  Diamonds are a bullshit monopoly mark up that are worth next to nothing on the secondary market.  Talk to your fianc\u00e9e to be, and find out if financial security, planning for retirement and an emergency, and/or downpayment on a future house is less important to her than a more expensive ring. Find out if she would even be comfortable wearing $10K on her finger. You might be surprised by the answer.\n\nThere are many cheaper rings that could be just as meaningful. Anything ranging from a diamond-lookalike (CZ or other clear stone), a non-diamond stone (her birthstone, assuming she's not born in April, or just a color she likes), an antique ring (either purchased or an heirloom), or something you have custom made.\n\nI proposed to my wife with a family heirloom ring (from her side, but there were a few floating around in my family as well), but had that not been available I likely would've proposed with a cheap costume jewelry ring and then we would've picked out a permanent ring together as our first joint financial decision.\n\nIf her financial goals don't align with yours, you might want to think twice before entering into this marriage. I went with an Amora gem diamond replacement which is the next gen Moissanite when I proposed and got a 1.5ct gem with great color and clarity set in platinum for around $1,400.  About $500 of that is the platinum setting and the rest is the gem.  You'd probably add another zero to that for an equivalent quality/size diamond.  The dealer let me look at a diamond and an amora side by side and you can't tell the difference.  Everything you'd want in a diamond can be found in an amora except the name.  Hardness, brilliance, clarity, and lasting forever.  I know I probably sound like a shill for amora gems but I was so pleased with myself when I found them I get giddy any time I get the chance to recommend it.\n\nIf you go with an Amora you can order direct from the company that grows them here: betterthandiamond.com and then get it set by a jeweler of your choice.  They're sold out at the moment but you could either wait or search for a jeweler in your area which is what I did.\n\nWhatever you ultimately decide to buy obviously make sure to shop around and inspect it yourself in person if at all possible.  I was super wary of buying from a site like Blue Nile for that reason.  I wanted to see it in my hand so I understood fully what I was getting.  Sizes can be deceiving based on pictures for example. I bought my wife's ring for about $400 from a guy on Craig's List. My wife loves that ring. Little Diamond with a gold ring that is unique. This may be an extreme example but I have friends paying off CC debt who think I'm the smartest person in the world for that move. If you're spending 5 figures you're a crazy person or you have \"F You Money\". I personally find wedding rings to be a racket. Diamonds are a false monopoly, the markup on retail jewellery is insane and the resale value on used jewellery is almost nil. Personally I would want a ring under 2k and use the rest of my money for a decent wedding, a fun honeymoon and building our life together. Some people see the cost of the ring as an extension of how much they value you. I personally don't. But I don't know your GF, and if you don't know how she feels about this then you should talk to her.  Doing something just because of tradition based on an ad campaign doesn't make sense. If you want to spend a huge chunk of money on a ring, go for it. \n\nI thought differently and got a moissanite  ring for $300. My, now, wife was super happy that I didn't blow all that money on a ring. We would rather spend money on our dogs or vacations. Talk it over with her before you do anything.  I'm a person who likes diamonds.  I have a nice engagement ring.  I've been married for over 30 years and not a day goes by that I don't look at it and smile.\n\nHowever, I'm perfectly happy with a \"used\" diamond.  You can get them for much cheaper than new retail.  Either use something like idonowidont.com or find something nice on craigslist and meet the people at your jeweler's place and pay them to check it out.  The appraisals sellers have are nonsense.  Appraisals generally are greatly inflated. Great suggestions on here already, but if you insist on a 5k ring just save until you have enough without messing up your savings AND DEFINITELY DON'T PUT ANY IN A CC. Particularly, for an engagement ring you can buy a cheap band and always go get a more expensive one later or even take her with you. Don't think that getting married \"sooner\" is going to make your relationship any better than it already is. The relationship is and will always be what you two continually decide to put into it married or not. So you getting a piece of jewelry won't change that one bit. \n\nDo what's right long term and don't stress over a rock and piece of metal. Focus on the relationship and material things will come in due time. Good luck and congratulations on your future marriage! Please don't tell me you'd spend $10,000 on a ring... At the time i proposed in 2015 i made 32k a year. I paid just under 1k for the ring and that was plenty. Ring prices are soooo inflated/overrated. The whole idea of spending a boatload is based on advertisements from diamond companies [tips tinfoil hat].  I told my FH I didn't want him to spend more then $800 on a ring. I'd much rather have that money in our emergency fund or being saved towards our first home. We ended up realizing I had my grandma's wedding ring and my family was fine with us taking out that stone and having it reset. We bought a setting for $700 and paid $100 for the work to have it reset. I now have a ring that was appraised at $3,500 that we only spent $800 on. Try to be creative and see if you can repurpose any old family jewelry. We also considered getting a white sapphire or CZ to save money as well. It's not about how much you spend. Several places offer 0% for x months. If you plan to put an amount aside anyway but want/need the ring sooner this isn't always a bad thing. Also, there are ALWAYS deep discounts on jewellery. Look into used rings (aka ones offered but refused) as they tend to be 40% or more off. http://www.moissanitebridal.com/ Not really finance advice\n\nHave you considered proposing with a piece of costume jewellery and then picking the ring together- she will (hopefully) be wearing this ring for the rest of her life- don't spend a lot of money on something she might not like, let her pick, she might have some very specific ideas about what she wants Have you considered buying just the diamond, and getting it set into a ring later? This would reduce the initial cost so you've got time to save up to get it set. Often jewelers will put a diamond into a basic setting so you've got a proper ring to propose with, but then she can design the permanent setting herself. \n\nI do suggest getting her opinion on things! Three of my friends got engaged within the past year, one is really happy with her ring, but the other two aren't, one of them just doesn't like the design, the other hates how huge and blingy her ring is.  I bought my wife's at a pawn shop. we added some diamonds and had it re-dipped (white gold). it was wayyyy cheaper than a jewelry store. they are a ripoff As others have said, by buying an engagement ring you do know you're just falling into one of the biggest advertising ploys of the last century in parting idiots with their well earned money.\n\nYou don't need to buy an expensive ring unless you have money you want to throw away. If she really loves you, she wouldn't care.\n\nMy experience with people who buy expensive rings are people who have not courted very long and are trying to woo with money..... people who have courted a while understand how important money is when embarking on a life together and how much better that money can be used to provide a better future.\n\nThat said, good luck for your future together Screw diamond engagement rings, they're a scam. Buy a nice ring made by an artisan with a stone that's much prettier and less expensive- it will be more meaningful than a consumer-oriented garbage diamond. Etsy has tons of beautiful things and the Tourmaline Kings group on Facebook has a bunch of really awesome wire wrappers and jewelry makers. \n\nDiamonds are lame, buy something cool. If you really want to spend a ton of money though buy her an Alexandrite ring, they're so cool! Alexandrite changes colour depending on the light. Careful for fakes though. Spend less on the ring and more on the honeymoon.  My wife and I decided on getting her a white sapphire instead of a diamond. Saved us thousands and no one but us knows. I spent a total of $1500 tops on her engagement and wedding ring.  [diamondssuck.com](http://diamondssuck.com/) read this. If shiny rock required, buy Moissanite and be happy with the savings (or go on a honeymoon with it). Look are Brilliant Earth, Blue Nile, or James Allem and order a diamond online. You can get one with more than a carat for 5-8k Buy a promise ring and wait until you can safely afford to buy the engagement ring that you want. It is NEVER a good idea to put yourself in any form of financial stress because of a ring... You could always make one, go to a local carpenter and see if you can work with them.

Plus it feels good to pay them off! Don't get rid of your credit cards. Learn self control. Credit cards help build credit which saves you money in the long run and are safer. I had a roommate who's debt cardgot 800 charged. He was short 800 for two weeks until they fixed it. With a credit card you don't lose the 800 since it isn't your money stolen You should do a balance transfer and consolidate all your debt to one card. A lot of banks have promotional rates that are very low for bal transfers. Then you can just throw your whole tax return at 1 debt with a lower interest rate than splitting it up.

It turns out the home loan I found during my credit report was with me as an authorized user counting my dad's loan, which was a relief. I also spoken with my parents threatening to prosecute them for fraud for the 17 year old account, they said they'll get the collection fixed (since apparently it was a glitch and it was paid, they showed me proof) and pay back all my debt. Their reasoning was \"we wanted to build you up credit while we raised you as an adult.\" Would I be an accessory of fraud for not reporting this? Is that something they can do? I was an authorized user on this one, and the primary one is 4 years old.\n\nShould I start pressing charges?

This differs from a joint credit, but since you keep saying authorized I'm assuming you mean you are an authorized user on their cards Be prepared to file against them for fraud. \"Building up credit\" doesn't take a lifetime. This was purely selfish, and them denying it is further proof of that.  Even with good intentions, I don't get why parents do this. Ask you need to do is add your child as an authorized user on an old credit card with good history and they get credit for the entire life of the card. Even if they have only been an authorized user due a week. That is exactly what I did to get my husband's credit up 120 points in just a couple months (he had nothing bad, just hardly anything on his credit history) and what I intend to do for children on their 18th birthday. I probably won't even give the kids the card.  /r/legaladvice, but I think it is not a question of you \"filing\". You have the choice to report it to the police, and then it is up to the police whether to pursue them.\n\nAgain, I'm not an attorney; anyone can sue anyone else for pretty much anything, but that doesn't mean they have a case.  If you could show that you suffered damages, that might be a thing. I get the feeling I'll be downvoted hard for this, but I just hope you think everything through before you make a decision on whether to press charges or not.\n\nI just want to note that...while it doesn't take a lifetime to build credit like another redditor mentioned mentioned, it could also be valid.\n\nMy parents did that for me, albeit only with some small credit cards and they were always paid off, and it was all made visible and clear to me when I got old enough to understand. Once I was handling my own finances, they turned everything over to me cleanly with no outstanding debt and no delinquent payments.\n\nI don't know your full situation, but it's not impossible that that really was your parents' intent, and they let things get away from them. I only mention this because it sounds like your parents are at least very willing to straighten things out with you, and I don't want you to potentially jeopardize your relationship with your family if that was the case. Find out if you are defined as the primary or authorized user on these accounts before you blow up at your parents anymore. It is distinctly possible that they honestly listed you on the accounts to bolster your credit rating instead of trying to commit fraud. If the accounts are in your name only and aren't being paid then go for fraud. Don't burn your bridges until you are sure they need to be burned.  You will not be arrested as an accessory to fraud against yourself.  You don't need debt to build credit. Just having a card open with zero balance or expenses on it builds credit. Well, it's one way to build credit. In fact debt can hurt your credit if the debt to credit ratio is high [removed] You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [What's the best way to pay down my debt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_what.27s_the_best_way_to_pay_down_my_debt.3F)\n- [Dealing with collections](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections)\n- [Credit Repair](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you are getting a loan soon, you may want to wait. Otherwise, read the FAQ, get what you want, and get a loan later.

Save your money, I'd save at least 50% mostly toward good things, like college and retirement, learn about compound interest. Donate 10% wether to your mom or something else that you love, and then spend the rest and enjoy it.    \"Invest in yourself. Your career is the engine of your wealth.\" - Paul Clitheroe\n\nAbsolutely you should go to college. Are you a freelancer/contractor/1099? Remember to pay taxes, it's your income. Look up online \"how to pay taxes as a freelancer.\"\n\nAlso, buy a cheap car. Don't buy new. \n\nOh, and people on this sub will be jealous of you. Yes, you will have to file taxes next year.  Your car choice is largely dependent on your employment status; I wouldn't buy it until you've either been at the company for the better part of a year or if you can buy it outright.  If you lose your job for any reason, it's doubtful you'd find an equivalent job quickly.\n\nAs a software engineer myself, my biggest piece of advice is: **do not skip on a degree.**\n\nThat money may be good now, but that's really lucky.  Most employers in the field look down on you if you don't have a degree.  If you want to be part of a software team, you'll need a degree to keep doors open, and remote positions are fairly difficult to find.\n\nBasically, I'm telling you not to count on this being a stable career path.  If it turns out to lead to something great, then that's awesome, but the responsible thing to do when it comes to finances is to plan for the worst. Don't let the job go to your head. If you have a college plan/opportunity, stick with it.\n\nKnow how your employer is classifying your employment. Are you an employee or an independent contractor? If the latter, you are responsible for withholding and sending your own tax payments.

Since your 16 and I assume you don't have many bills. I'd save as much as possible for college(I'd get at least associates that's all my hubby has an is a software engineer and makes 130k a year) and save for a car(don't go crazy get a car under 15k). Then you can save the rest for when you move out on a few years. You should be able to save at least 60k before your out of highschool! This will put you in a great position once you graduate.  I would say spend $5000 on a Honda or Toyota, max. Something reliable and older, with ~100k miles. When you go to school and pay that off (you should go to school- I would recommend software engineering but whatever niche your in, go for it) then you can get a nicer car. Congrats!

My employer pays monthly on the last business day of the month, so today was my first paycheck with the increased rate. However the increase in my take-home pay was not nearly what I had figured it would be after doing some quick post-it math a few weeks ago - it was only about $40 more than my last paycheck. After reviewing my paystubs from December 2016 and January 2017 (today's), I noticed that my federal withholding almost doubled, while all other withholdings (Medicare, SS, state etc) only increased by ~15%, same as my pay increase.\n\n\nMy post-it math assumed a 26% tax rate. After deducting my 401k contributions (same percentage but higher salary), then 26% tax rate, then taking out medical/dental - I arrived at a $544 monthly increase in take-home. My paycheck today has a $40.59 increase. Granted, my post-it math may be off a bit, but it doesn't explain that much of a discrepancy.\n\n\nI live within my means and am avoiding lifestyle creep, but I'm concerned because I was planning on shoving all of that extra take-home straight into savings, so I can put a huge chunk down on a new-to-me car later this year. Not to mention only receiving a $40 increase in take-home when I've earned a $9k salary increase would be super depressing. I'm gonna be so frustrated if this is legit.\n\n\nInfo:\n\n* Salary was $58,652; as of January 1 I received a 15% increase to $67,500 - so no change in tax bracket\n* My employer pays monthly in 12 equal installments, so this is my first check at increased rate\n* I did not change any withholdings, 401k contributions, insurance selections, claim more dependents, nothing - all inputs for both pay periods are equal except salary.\n* Federal withholding almost doubled, from $534.93 to $1047.43.\n\n\nAny ideas of a) what caused this, and b) how do I go about fixing it? I've already reviewed with our comptroller who deals with our payroll company, and he didn't know why my federal withholding would double - so he has emailed his contact at the payroll company. Haven't heard back yet.\n\n\nTL;DR: Received salary increase of just under $9k, however first paycheck at new rate only had $40 increase in take-home. Same tax bracket.

Below is a quick summary of our current financial situation and more in depth information on the 401K. \n\n\u2022\tCurrent Gross Annual Income: $125,000 (I\u2019m currently the sole source of income)  \no\tI can expect to making at least a .05% pay increase annually for the next few years. \n\n\u2022\t401K Contributions: 15% of my salary  \no\tEmployer matches 5% of 401K contributions   \no\tCurrent 401k balance: ~$92,000 \u2013 fully vested  \n\n\u2022\tCurrent Liquid Savings ~$22,000 in a Captial One savings account (this took a hit with the wedding)  \no\tCurrently contributing $1,100 per month to this savings account. \n\n\u2022\tCurrent Debts: ~$26,000 in wife\u2019s student loan debt. She is wrapping up her Associates this semester, but her Bachelors tuition is unknown since her next university hasn\u2019t been decided upon. Estimated at $15,000 annually.  Currently paying off at a rate of $600 per month.\n\nWe are planning to spend up to $350,000 on our home. We live in the Chicago Suburbs, so this is not difficult to do.  \n\nIf we wanted to save just enough to put 20% down ($70,000), it would take over 3.5 years to save enough in liquid savings.  I obviously would want to have a buffer on this, but this is the bare minimum scenario. \n\nI am contemplating reducing my 15% contribution to match my employer contribution of 5% in order to put more money into liquid savings quicker.  That would reduce my annual 401K contributions from ~$24,250 to $12,500,  putting this directly into my savings account would allow me to hit $70,000 in just two years.   \n\nMy biggest concern and question to /r/personalfinance, however, is how bad is of an impact would the reduction in $12,000 a year for nearly 2 years have on my future retirement (since I\u2019m missing out on $24,000 in compounding interest).  Is the proposed approach above the \u201cbest\u201d I can do in this situation if we want to move sooner rather than later? \n\nAny advice is appreciated! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n", "title": "What would the long term impact of reducing my 401K contributions for 2 years in order to save enough money to buy a house?", "comments": "You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [401(k) Fund Selection Guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k_funds)\n- [401(k) FAQs](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/401k)\n- [\"How to handle $\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

So ~$258,000 is the cost to your retirement account at age 65. The impact question has been answered so just to help you determine if you should or shouldn't do you have anywhere else you could cut costs? Perhaps current rent? If I did the math right (401k + monthly savings + student loans) that's $38,400 annually going somewhere - where is the rest of your income going? Also could your spouse get a part-time job either weekends or over the summer? \n\nOverall I personally would recommend not to cut back the 401k as it seems (on the surface at least) that you likely have other methods to save or obtain the necessary money. Another possible concern is the marginal tax rate that 12k is hitting if not going into the 401k.  You also don't mention the interest rate of the student loans; they may be worth tackling earlier too.

Situation at home made it impossible for me to cover the school costs so I postponed that while trying to help out as I could at home. Never went out at all, just went to work, came home, helped however I could.\n\nI have been considering moving out for the past year, trying to plan it out so that it is not a decision that leaves me living paycheck to paycheck in the end. Me and my friend have been discussing our plan of action and our original deadline was within 2 years. \n\nPlans changed when I was out with my girlfriend the other night and I had stayed out longer than I should have. Came back to the screen door being locked. My girlfriends aunt allowed me to spend the night at her place and when I got back my dad gave me the new rules. No staying out past 10, no visiting her after work without stopping home first (a 12 mile drive each way) and if these rules are broken, I no longer get to live there. I have no savings at the moment, my car just broke down 2 weeks ago, no established credit, it seems as though its an uphill battle to reach financial independence before my dad finds a reason to kick me out. I have to now get a second, full time job as well as keep my current job at reduced hours just to begin getting the income it seems I need. I will abide by his rules to the best of my abilities, but a year is a long time to continuously do so, especially for someone entering his 20s.\n\nAny advice on how I should be setting myself up to move out within say a year/ year and a half while being prepared to possibly be kicked out before then?\n\nEDIT: I may not have been as clear as I should have been in the original post. I'm my paying insurance, my phone, and whatever money is left over is expected to go towards food for my entire family(5 in total), often leaving me broke before the end of the week. Without my car I'm left taking Ubers to and from work($15-20 each way, working 4 days a week after boss cut everyone's hours), costing me significant amounts of my earnings, plus every time in the past that I have tried to save in the past, my mom would guilt me into spending that on their bills that were past due. It's that cycle that pushes me to want to leave, but at the same time makes it hard to do so. Sorry if I was not this clear in the original post.\n\nMy question is really what are some key things I should note in terms of how much I should be saving. What expenses should I be preparing for when saving for both short and longer term possibilities. Also what's the best way to be ready if worst case scenario happens and I do get kicked out?", "title": "Turning 20, How should I prepare to move out within the next year while being ready for the possibility of being kicked out before then?", "comments": "What other rules do you break when they become inconvenient?\n\nAnd im not sure what your real question is.

Part of the latter is that a credit report gets run, and anything that comes up (i.e. having outstanding debts, collections) is discussed. For me, there were two, both of which I had not realized I had up until yesterday, when I met with the person in charge of running my background check. Surprisingly, he didn't have very much information on either, just account numbers for both, and that one was \"medical\". So the medical one I tracked down immediately after and took care of; I had a visit to an ER once in 2015 when I was doing a semester in Maryland, and when I left the hospital I did not receive my updated address information, so they couldn't tell me I owed anything, and I assumed insurance covered it, but I was wrong-- insurance covered the deductible, but not the procedure itself. Regardless, I cleared that one up, so I'm fine there. \n\nWhen I found out I had these two outstanding debts to pay, I left from my meeting with the background check guy and went home to do a credit report (I used expedia), something that I haven't really done (I know you are supposed to every year or so) aside from checking my FICO score in my credit card app from time to time. Under collections, it showed just one debt, and that was the one I owed to the hospital, previously mentioned, which I paid off in full yesterday. There was nothing else there on my credit report under collections, just that one debt, but the guy I spoke with showed me two. When I talked to him later and told him how I paid off the hospital debt, I asked him if he had any other info about the smaller debt (it's only $124), he said no, just an account number. He didn't have any other information besides that. Not who was collecting it, not who it was for, not what it was for, nothing. \n\nSo my question is, does anyone know a way in which I can find out to whom I owe this debt, given that a credit report did not even have that information, and that I have not been contacted in anyway regarding owing someone that amount? My background checker said that $124 collection opened in December 2016, so it was recent, but again, that is all the information he had.\n\nThe good news is, this will not negatively impact my background check, but more than anything I do not like having any kind of unnecessary debt, plus I'm very curious as to what this could be.\n\nAny and all help is greatly appreciated, thank you in advance.", "title": "Looking for help in finding out more information about collections I owe...", "comments": "You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [What's the best way to pay down my debt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_what.27s_the_best_way_to_pay_down_my_debt.3F)\n- [Dealing with collections](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/collections)\n- [Credit Repair](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/credit_building#wiki_i_have_bad_credit.2C_and_i_am_looking_to_repair_it.)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

You're not saving money by buying a home before you have kids. It'll still cost the same no matter what order you do it in. It might take less time to save up for a down payment if you're not also paying for child related expenses, but it won't actually cost less.\n\nBuying things you can afford isn't a bad thing. It should, in fact, always be your goal.\n\n> The reason we're considering this route is because shes 34 and i'm 33 and we have no children and i don't want to have a child living in a two bedroom condo that occupies 2 people and 2 pets.\n\nWhy on earth not? Two bedroom sounds like the exact right amount of bedrooms for parents (1 bedroom) and a kid (1 bedroom). I can promise you the kid won't care whether their bedroom is in a condo or a huge house. It'll be years before a kid can even notice what kind of house they live in.\n\n> i'm afraid that if we get to a 300-400k place(we're in vegas btw)that we will get complacent, have children, and basically never have my dream home.\n\nWhy are you measuring your dream house by how much it *costs* and not by *how much you actually like the house*? You might like a house that costs 600k. You may also find a house you like that costs 300k. Even if you're looking at a specific house now, you're talking about buying in two years. The market will be completely different then. Unless you're looking at a specific house and know it'll be available for purchase in Jan 2019, which seems odd and still gives you two years to look at other houses.\n\nYour monthly expenses are $5000, and you claim to be taking home $15,000 gross at a minimum. Even after taxes, you should have thousands of dollars left over a month with those numbers. How have you only saved up 20k after two years of owning the condo?\n\nCould you save up 100k in two years? Theoretically, with the numbers you list, yes. But it's been two years since you \"drained your savings\" with the home purchase, and you've only managed to save 20k. Either you're leaving out a bunch of necessary expenses, or you have a ton of discretionary expenses, which doesn't bode well as far as buckling down and amping up your savings.\n\nLet's get this out of the way: Yes, it's a bad idea to defer your student loans. You'll end up paying even more in interest. If the numbers you mention are accurate, you absolutely shouldn't have to defer them to save up the amount you want. At this point, it's less about whether or not the pure numbers work out, and more about whether or not you can actually cut back your lifestyle to achieve your goals and stick to it. From your post, it really doesn't sound like you can. I'd take a long, hard look at what you're trying to achieve. >  i'm afraid that if we get to a 300-400k place(we're in vegas btw)that we will get complacent, have children, and basically never have my dream home.\n\nAdjust your dreams to something more reasonable. (i.e. the 300-400k home) You have $330k in debt, $220k/year unsteady income, no savings.  It doesn't sound like you can afford your current lifestyle, let alone lifestyle inflation.\n\nI would seriously consider whether you can even get a $450k mortgage in your situation.  That may not be possible, in which case you'd need a much larger (200k+) down payment. Unfortunately, the answer is no. Also, if you buy that $550-600K home, what happens when you have your kids if your wife wants to stay home with them or only work part-time?  Not going to happen you say?

We are considering building a new house in a 5 year old subdivision that has lots of room to grow. This neighborhood has extremely reasonable pricing on building houses. A lot of the advise I read online about buying a house pertains to buying an already built house. Do you have any advice for building a home? What do you wish you would have known before building?

Yes maybe small increases like 2-4% a year, but that isn't enough to cover selling costs if you sell in <5-6 years.  We built back before the real estate bubble. It was our first house and didn't have a clue.\n\nBiggest mistakes we made:\n\n1. Not getting upgrades because it seemed expensive at the time\n\n\n2. Not pre-wiring enough. This could be lights, TV, networking, phones, etc. \n\nIt's definitely going to be a learning process. \n\nI wish we had done more but it just seemed so expensive back then. Small things can always be changed in the future but bigger items like room extensions and extensive wiring are more difficult and much more expensive later on. A good piece would advice is 4.5 months is probably conservative. Expect the build to take longer, by a couple of months. We signed a purchase agreement for a new construction home in a new subdivision back in June. Builder said expect closing on December 28, basically 5.5 months. Here I am at the end of January and they've only just finished the drywall. I'm now expecting a mid March close, so 2.5 months off schedule. \n\nOther than that the advice is similar. Don't overbuy and don't over customize. It's very easy to ramp up the coat of your home when you get into the design center. If you over customize your appraisal won't land and you'll have to pay more out of pocket to meet your financing requirements. Skip simple upgrades that you can do yourself cheaper and focus only on big ticket items at the studio: cabinets, countertops, flooring, recessed lighting, electrical prewiring, structural changes, etc. Even with flooring see if your builder will allow you to purchase your own material and have your own people install during construction. Scheduling this can be difficult but if you can do it you'll save a bunch. \n\nDon't buy silly builder upgrades like LED bulbs, ceiling fans, chandeliers, etc. Same with appliances, don't buy from the builder unless they give you a great deal. There is no need to finance a fridge, washer, and dryer for 30 years.  Are you buying from a home builder? As in you go pick out a plan and pick out the interior colors etc?\n\nOr is this a custom home, where you are finding the lot and need to hire an architect and engineering to design a home.\n\nBuying a new home you pay for it just like others have said. A normally they build new homes on the fringes of established real estate areas so they are the hardest hit and slowest to recover from market dips.\n\nI would talk with an agent in the area not representing the home builder, and see what there is in that area for comparison. One home builder here builds in phases, so if you are new coming along trying to buy in phase 2 your paying 10-20% more than what a used phase 1 sells for as resale. \n\nAlso keep in mind you can negotiate with new home sales form upgrades to pricing, having an agent can tell you how hot or cold the market is, the colder it is the more discounts and upgrades you ask for. I wouldn't buy new construction in a hot market since you always end up overpaying and waiting for years for the market to recover post crash. (an example of a hot market would be people in a lottery for a spot to purchase a home or condo in a development that hasn't broken ground or is in planning stages)\n\nAlso another topic is lending, they will want to use in house lending and try and offer discounts to entice you.

Hope it's helpful to someone.\n\nQuick background picture:\n\n-Wife and I make 150k/yr combined \n\n-15k Emergency fund. \n\n-No debts (only mortgage)\n\n-I drive a 2001 Honda Accord with 138k miles, she drive a 2008 Honda Civic with 55k miles\n\nWife and I were 7 months pregnant when we decided we needed an SUV type vehicle for when the baby arrived. Safety features were obviously top priority, along with utility for hauling whatever crap we had to haul around everywhere when the baby got here.\n\nWe were looking at a couple vehicles, and ultimately stayed in the Honda family and got a 2016 CR-V. When we sat down with the salesman, I had heard horror stories about leasing and had a million questions and took about 2 weeks before deciding on lease. Let me make it clear that our intention going into this was to not trade it in for another car. We wanted to buy outright, but with the unknown of a baby coming into the picture, emptying out our savings (not EF) probably wasn't the best idea.\n\n\nOut the door price if we bought that day: $27,915.75\n\n\nWe had 2 lease options to choose from: $4,000 down payment for 3 year lease, or $598 down payment for 3 year lease. Both options only changed the monthly payment by about $40, so we chose the $598 down. Had we put 4k down, our total payments would have been 11754.04 after 36 months. $598 puts us at   11929.16 after 36 months. 200 dollar difference for 3.5k down payment difference up front? We'll take it.\n\nSo after that was figured out, we have our residual value, which is our buyout price. For the CR-V, residual was set to $17,259.95. So after money down + payments + residual we were looking at a total of $29,189.11 for the car if we leased. More than the out the door price, but was the extra money we spent leasing going to be worth it? Let's run the math.\n\nOur current car payment is $314. If we bought it and put 8k down (basically our savings at the time), payment would have come through at $340. We would have been able to finance at a rate of 1.5% interest, but would have left us with no money in savings.\n\n\n\nSo do we drain savings and have a $340/mo payment, or put $600 down and have a lower similar payment, but pay more over the long run? The amount we're going to pay minus the amount we could have paid total was a whooping difference of $1273.36. We're paying an extra $40/mo to lease rather than buy.\n\nWhen the lease is up we'll pay in cash. Each month I pay \"extra\" to the car by earmarking money in our account to make the final payment. If something does happen, we'll finance with my credit union for a 1 year loan @ 0.9% interest.\n\nIs that $40 worth it? To us, yes it was. With a baby on the way, and all the unknowns that entails, I would rather have a nice nest egg to sit on in case of something catastrophic instead of worrying about $40 extra a month that I could be saving.\n\nThis happened in October, and since then we gave birth to a beautiful baby girl, and we love the car.\n\nIf I missed anything or if anyone has questions, ask away. \n\nEdit: \n\nA LOT of salt in the comments.

Don't kid yourself. First, you don't \"need\" an SUV, especially since hilariously, the CR-V is an upright Civic.\n\nSecond, your lease needs to look at total amount paid. If a 2001 Accord worked for you, why wouldn't for example, a 2014 CR-V? Why not cut out the middle man, and jump straight from leasing to simply going and buying someone's used CR-V, that you now KNOW that is worth no more than $17,300 plus nominal refurbishment fee, and save yourself $12,000 in payments?\n\nYou just admitted in that post that you are paying $1,300 more for the car by doing lease-to-own than if you simply purchased it in the first place. Let's re-title your post \"This is why paying $29,100 for a CR-V makes sense instead of simply paying $27,900 for the EXACT same car, or just buying a $17,000 car instead, which is just as reliable and economical.\" Saying that it worked for you because you FAILED to properly set up an emergency fund or properly fund your auto savings, keeping you from having to pay unnecessary expenses is simply a weak justification. Pay an extra $1,200 here, an extra $700 there, etc. and it's the difference between doing all right and true financial stability. 1. You didn't need an SUV just because were having a baby.\n2. You especially didn't need a brand new SUV just because you were having a baby. Along with the other comments I hope you realize that when you make $150k a year it puts you into a lot better position to make poor financial decisions. It's not going to ruin your finances due to the large income, but don't kid yourself thinking it was the right choice financially. People with a < $50k income make the same choice and are demolished by buying new vehicles they didn't need. Potential pitfalls I don't see addressed.\n\nMost leases have a buyout fee. This ranges from perhaps $150-600.\n\nWhat state you are in depends on how taxes are paid on a lease. In the worst case scenario you paid tax on the full price of the vehicle when you leased, and you pay tax again on the purchase price when you buy it out.\n\nCars that lease well typically have high residuals. High residuals are often artificially propped up by the manufacturer. This may make your buyout more expensive than buying the equivalent vehicle on the used market.\n\nYou've somehow spun the extra $1273 you paid to lease the car as a savings. That's a lot of extra money, yes, even over 3 years.\n\nNow leasing can be done smartly, but a good lease should have a lower overall cost than a purchase, and for a car that will likely be a poor candidate for a buyout at the end (because of the propped-up residual that made it a good lease in the first place). In that case you turn in the car, let the manufacturer take the loss, and if you really want another one of those cars to buy, you buy it at a much lower cost on the used market. >A LOT of salt in the comments.

Free spending tends to lead most people to a life of financial worry, having to work until they are 65+, and even then not really having enough to live comfortably on. \n\nThe alternative is not to live miserably until you are 65-70. It is to find enjoyment from life other than spending money. I am a car guy and I guarantee you I don't get any less enjoyment from my inexpensive cars than I would from an expensive one. It's how we choose to frame our expectations. Driving inexpensive vehicles and not spending freely means that you can live a life free of financial worry, likely retire comfortably in your 40's or early 50's, and have enough to do whatever you like during some of the prime years of your life. That's a good trade-off IMO. My issue is that in 3 years, you have to get *another* new car.  There is no time when you're not paying a payment.

If so, then no one can claim you as a dependent. \n\nSince you have made payments on your student loans, it's possible you are eligible for the student loan interest deduction. So use Form 1040, rather than 1040EZ.\n\nIf you cannot be claimed as a dependent, then use \"1\" on line 6d if you have only yourself as an exemption. This will mean that later on line 42 you will subtract 4050 from your income before calculating income tax.\n\nYour wages from your two W-2 box 1 get added together and go on 1040 line 7.\n\nYour bank interest of $50 goes on 1040 line 8a.\n\nYour acorns account might have had a gain, but if you didn't sell anything the gain is \"unrealized\" and isn't counted as income. But if you received dividends or you actually sold and had a capital gain of $2, then you would report that income. It would be 9a if dividends, or line 13 if short-term capital gain. (You might have to use Schedule B or D.)\n\nYour student loan interest deduction would get subtracted on line 33. See the instructions for Form 1040 about how to see what amount goes there.\n\nOn page 2 of 1040, at the top, you subtract 6300 in standard deduction, and 4050 in exemption. This leaves very little of your income as being taxable income. You'd be in the 10% tax bracket, and only the amount *above* that 10350 income would get taxed. Look up the tax on your taxable income in the Tax Table in the instructions.\n\nWould you be eligible for any education tax credits because you are not a dependent? It depends on whether you had any qualified education expenses. If your scholarship entirely covers your tuition and related expenses, you don't have education expenses. But if you had expenses beyond that, see Publication 970 to determine if you would be getting any tax credit on line 50 and line 68. \n\nYou should also look into whether you are eligible for Earned Income Credit. You could be if age 25 or older and you don't have a child; or any age if you have at least one qualifying child. See line 66 and its instructions.\n\nTax credit reduces the tax you found on line 44.\n\nIf you had health insurance coverage all year, then check the box on line 61 and leave the line empty.\n\nLast step is to make sure you tell the IRS how much income tax you've already paid. Look at W-2s in box 2 and add those together. That goes on 1040 line 64.\n\nYou compare what your total tax is and what your payments were. The difference determines whether you get a refund (line 75) or you owe something (line 78).\n\nYou can do this with free software starting at www.irs.gov/freefile or you could just download 1040 and its instructions, and the relevant other forms, as necessary, fill them in and mail it in. If you do it on paper, don't forget to sign and date the form, attach your W-2 federal stubs, photocopy it before mailing, and send it to the address in the instructions. Different address is used if you are making a payment than if you are expecting a refund.

You send an offer to a seller for their house, and you negotiate price and the details of the deal.  What you are pre-approved for is not their business and has no part in the negotiation process.\n\n>How do I figure out how much house I want?\n\nYour lifestyle and goals determine 'how much' house you want.  It's safe to assume you need at least one bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a living room.  Do you want an office?  A guest room?  A roommate?  Do you a hobby or something that needs for a large garage or detached space?\n\n>What factors beside square footage will impact maintenance time and upkeep costs?\n\nCondition.\n\n>Things that aren't important to me personally but have a large impact on resale value.

Ask what kind of place they live in.  Make note of what they say.  It's life.  What kind of climate you live in will affect your utilities, some places are on sewer, some septic...

Can you all give me a sense of what kind of an undertaking that is in terms of cost and time. Say per 15 x 15ft room with 9 ft ceiling.\n\nThat depends on your motivation.

You'll do paperwork sometimes called a purchase agreement, which outlines the condition of the sale, and earnest money to indicate you're a committed buyer. This will be presented to the seller or the seller's agent. In turn they may accept, reject, or counter-offer.\n\n> A. How do I figure out how much house I want?\n\nTake into consideration how much time you intend to live there, the space required for your belongings, any things in the future you might want such as a boat, extra vehicle, motorcycle, etc. Is it just you or a family, or will you have a family in the future, is entertaining guests important to you, etc. Typically everyone starts out with a list of what they want, then after looking at homes they're able to decide what they're willing to compromise.\n\n> What factors beside square footage will impact maintenance time and upkeep costs?\n\nLook up the property tax information. Different counties can have different property tax laws. A corner lot could have different tax responsibilities than other homes. Repair of streets, curbs, street lights, sidewalks, sewer, etc. are all things you might be responsible for. Condition and type of roof, gutter, siding, and so on. For example, the home could have interlock shingles and present difficulty or higher cost when getting home insurance.\n\n> B. Things that aren't important to me personally but have a large impact on resale value. An example is an attached master bath is big for resale value, but i don't really care. I think attached garage is probably another... what else fits in here?\n\nIt generally depends on what the buyer wants. Like you said, you don't really care about a master bath. Someone might buy a house without a bath tub, but that could be important for someone who has toddlers. Location is a big factor. Property taxes, schools, churches, shopping, crime rate, neighborhood, etc.\n\n> C. How can I begin to figure out upkeep costs and other misc expenses.\n\nYou can request utility bills from the seller and that can be a useful indicator of what to look at more closely. A high heating bill could mean many things like poor/no insulation, drafty windows, hollow exterior doors, etc. Without an inspection or experience with what to look for you won't really know.\n\n> D. I'm under the impression that a house with ugly wall paper/paint is easy to fix. Can you all give me a sense of what kind of an undertaking that is in terms of cost and time. Say per 15 x 15ft room with 9 ft ceiling.\n\nDepends if you do it yourself or not. Good paint can be more expensive than you think, and some wallpapers can be incredibly time-consuming to remove or impossible without damaging sheet rock. If you're not doing it yourself call a few local contractors and get estimates.\n\n> E. Tips tricks to dealing with potential sellers, anything else to help me be as savvy a buyer as possible.\n\nAsk your realtor for a comparative market analysis for the home, also sometimes called comps or comparables. This will give you an idea of the value of the home in comparison to similar homes.

We are living on the 2nd floor of a liquor store. It's a 2 bedroom, 1 bathroom apartment with a living room, dining room and small kitchen. We have 5 radiators and 3 baseboards for heating. The only baseboard we use is in the 2nd bedroom, and it is only on when my roommate is home (which is about 3-4 days per week for a few hours in the evening). The apartment is located in Lambertville, NJ.\n\nOur first electric bill was $138, and we were blown away. It wasn't even for a full month, as it was our first bill since we had moved in on December 5th, and we were told the utility bills were low by our landlord. We turn off all the lights when we leave the house, and since our first bill, I have made sure to turn off appliances when they are not in use also (microwave, coffee maker, etc). My roommate was also away for 2 weeks, so the electric heat was hardly used for our second billing period, and our second bill was $127 (ONLY $11 CHEAPER). I feel like something is not right. My parents pay this amount for their entire 3 bedroom, 2 story home. Any leads on what I could do? Could I be paying for someone else's usage?", "title": "HELP!

There's a very good chance that part of the electric for the store is running off your meter.  Call the utility to ask if they can help test for this.

I think mist987 has the right idea, maybe you can have the power company verify that none of the store's electric running off of your meter. Your electric rates are pretty high (16 cents/KWh) and electric heat is relatively expensive compared to gas heat I think - if you have badly insulated/sealed windows and doors I think your bill could make sense without anyone else using your electricity. \n\nBut like someone else said, if you read your meter and then turn literally everything in the apartment off for a couple hours and then read it again, you should be able to easily tell if someone else is using it. You might have to look up how to convert the numbers on the meter into actual power used.  Sounds like you might have an electric water heater if electric is the only utility on your bill.

High electric bill in small apartment!"}{"body": "Hi, I was just wondering if there is anybody out there who could help me with my credit score. I've been trying to improve it now for quite some time but to no avail. \n\nBasically I'm still quite young, I am 20 and have been with my bank now, Natwest for 3 years. Since I finished school, I went on and worked full time, so I've been receiving a full time wage for I'd say that past 2 years or so. \n\nI recently changed my job just under a year ago and I am now earning more than what I previously did, again like all jobs, my wage is paid monthly into my account.  All the times I have been with Natwest I have never had an overdraft, never have I had a credit card and never have I loaned any money.  Also, I think another important factor in this is that I also have never had any sort of direct debit. Absolutely never. Not once have I had a bill to pay, not even something as simple as my phone bill. I live at home with my mother, so I am quite fortunate (for now) I think this in itself is the reason for my credit score being so low? My score is only in the 100s; 149 to be precise which is pathetically low.\n\nBack in August I took out a small loan with Natwest. This was in hopes of maybe slightly improving my credit score. I only took out \u00a31000 which isn't much, especially since I am working full time and have no other outcome. The plan was for me to loan 1k and to pay back \u00a31200 over 1 year, which I thought was great. However, I hated the thought of having to pay back something for such a long period of time and in the ended I ended up paying all the loan off (with the added interest on top), all in one. I thought this would have helped, but if anything it actually lowered my score???? \n\nSo now I am here with literally no overdraft(by choice), no debt, no outcome, not a credit card but with an atrocious credit score of 149. I am not even eligible for a credit card with a limit of \u00a3100, despite the fact that I can more than afford it.\n\nDoes anybody have any tips/advice for me on how to improve my score :( I prevents me from doing EVERYTHING.\n\nThank you for your time.", "title": "Just a quick question, how can I improve my credit score?

For now I have allotted 100% to the Fidelity Advisor Freedom 2050 Fund - Class C which has an expense ratio above 1.5 percent. I do not have access to the low cost Spartan index funds.

I did a similar program, be ready to provide you bank statements and 3 years of W-2's in order to qualify. There are two forms of PMI, there is BPMI and LPMI. Borrower Paid mortgage insurance is what everyone thinks of, where you have a monthly installment of mortgage insurance. Lender Paid mortgage insurance is where the bank gives you a higher rate to pay for the mortgage insurance, then you do not have the monthly installment. \n\n\nJust briefly looking through their website and with the rates they advertise, my bet is they are doing the LPMI in that scenario which is why your rate is so much higher on that 20 year than most other loans.

My question would be do I aggressively pay down my 28k worth of federal student loan debt and try to clear it within a year or so or should I divert more of my cash flow to savings/retirement.\n\nPart 2) How or what should I begin to invest in to get an early jump start on saving for retirement?\n\nAdvice would be greatly appreciated!\n\nTL;DR - Should I aggressively pay off student debt or should I focus on investing for retirement?", "title": "Just graduated, how should I handle my student loan debt?", "comments": "What are your interests rates for your loans?\nIf you have a stable emergency fund, knock out the debt. No worries then. One quick piece of advice I've heard here is to compare the interest rates of your loans to the likely gains of a 401k (or other retirement) investment. \n\n\nFor example, I've heard the benchmark here to assume your retirement account will (on average) see gains of 4% annually. So if you have a student loan interest rate of 7%, it's better to pay down the loan first before worrying about retirement. Someone here please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\n\nWith that said it's good to get into the habit of saving for retirement as soon as possible. I've found the best way to learn is by doing. So for example I recommend starting to save for retirement ASAP if only to get in the habit and learn the different terms (portfolio, gains, contributions, matching, pre-tax vs. post-tax, expense ratios, etc) and also learn how those platforms work.  Pay as much as you can on your student loan while your expenses are still relatively low.  Any extra that you pay above your minimum goes right to the principal, which will ultimately reduce the amount of interest you pay.   The quicker you pay off your debt, the more money you'll be able to use for better things in the future (like putting more towards retirement or saving for a down payment on a home).\n\nIf your employer offers 401k match, contribute the maximum that they will match.  So if they match up to 3% of your pay, you should contribute 3% because it's 100% ROI (and 3% really isn't too much out of your paycheck).  Pay attention to when it vests, however.   You may not see that money your employer contributes if you leave before that time.  For example, my company's 401k vests after 3 years, so if I leave at 2 years and 6 months, I only keep the money I contributed to my 401k.\n\nBest of luck! If your interest rates were as high as mine I would advise you to continue living at home and pay off the student debt.

I need some assistance regarding a part of my taxes. If any of you could provide any assistance, I'd really appreciate it.\n\nHere's some background:\n\nI'm a 22-year old living in Atlanta. I'm filing using TurboTax. In 2016, I had 3 jobs total - Starbucks, Atlanta Braves and Uber. I've entered my Starbucks W-2. Still waiting on the Braves, so that's not in there. I've entered the amount I made through Uber, but I haven't deducted anything from that job as of yet. In previous years, it's always been a pretty easy filing session as all I've had to do was enter W-2s. Uber has shaken things up a bit.\n\nI came into the education section and that's where things got weird. So I was a student last year and was a half-time student for both the spring and fall semesters. I received a 2016 1098-T (I hadn't received this form since 2013). I entered that information (payments received for qualified tuition and related expenses, scholarships/grants) from the 1098-T and included a $150 deduction for books. (I don't know if this is relevant, but I had to take out loans for school in 2016). TurboTax tells me they're maximizing my education tax break and BOOM, my federal refund shoots from ~$120 to ~$1000. Mind you, this is before entering my other W-2 and any Uber deductions.\n\nShould I be receiving this? I'm going to run through things again and probably another couple of times after that, but I've never received this tax credit. Maybe I wasn't paying attention in previous years?

Loans are complex products, and there's more to them than just the APR. Look at all of the closing costs when comparing. APR as a metric sort of kind of tries to do this by adding in and spreading out the closing costs, but even so you can usually still make one loan look like it has a lower APR than another by jacking the points and origination fees way up. This lowers the nominal interest rate, but whether it's worth making a big upfront investment of prepaid interest to get a lower interest rate that may not even break even on the upfront cost for 7-10 years is going to vary from person to person.\n\nThat said, if the closing costs between loan A and loan B are similar, but loan B has a lower APR, then loan B is probably the way to go.\n\nService can matter also; if your application is kind of borderline you might be better served going with a lender that has a reputation for having excellent customer service. The only justification is that you feel more comfortable and want to stay loyal to your small business. That's pretty much it, unless there was some glaring difference in the contract.  I don't know if anyone has mentioned this, but going through a loan broker, they can offer you a slightly higher interest rate, but then you (borrower) also get funds from the lender (credit) toward your closing costs, impound account, and potentially the principal.

I am currently a freshman in college, and have both a job on campus and a job back in my hometown. During the school-year I make exactly $600/month, as I work 15 hours a week at $10 an hour. My job on campus is exempt from taxes, which was a very confusing and new thing to me at first. I currently have no real financial obligations, so most of my money is spent on snacks for my room, occasionally going out to eat, gas, and personal care items. I'd say if I really cut costs I could average about $500 a month could go into my savings. I currently have about $1500 saved up. I have had a Discover \"It\" credit card for about a year now. I typically spend about $50-60 a month on my credit card, and occasionally put large purchases like textbooks/dorm furniture on it so I can pay it off over a month or two if needed. That being said I've always payed my bill at least 2 weeks early each month, and almost always pay the full amount, but always at least the minimum.

Ideally I'm looking to purchase something in the $7000-$9000 range, such as a upper 2000s Toyota of some kind.

You never paid taxes during the year so now you owe them all of it. >  My W-2 is blank under federal income tax withheld\n\n> Did I fill out my W-4 wrong?\n\nYes, you filled it out wrong. Seems like you selected exempt when you shouldn't have.\n\nSince you are being claimed as a dependent, you don't get to claim your personal exemption. Which means your income is only adjusted by your standard deduction of $6,300.\n\n$11,000 - $6,300 = $4,700 in taxable income\n\nThat will all be taxed at the federal rate of 10%. So your federal tax will be $470.\n\nSeems odd that state taxes would bump you up to more than double that. Did you have any other W-2s? Did you have any other income from other sources like 1099, any investment income, etc?\n\nWhat does TurboTax say is the breakdown between federal and state income taxes?\n\nAlso, ask your employer for a new W-4 and fill that you so this doesn't happen again next year. It's worth repeating - don't freak out about having to come up with the entire amount all at once.  The IRS is great about working with you to put together a payment plan, as long as you show motivation to pay it off.  I've heard stories of payments as low as $50/month.  So file your return correctly and on time, and give them a call to figure things out. Claiming you as a dependent means that *they* get to file your 1098-T and claim the resulting tax credit, as well as the dependent exemption etc., and they're gonna get a bunch of money. Ask *very nicely* if they'd pretty please pay the tax bill which you only owe because you can't claim yourself and which is way less than the money they got by claiming you. \n\nYou do owe it, though, sorry. That's what happens when you don't withhold federal taxes.  Just out of curiosity, did you not notice that taxes were not being pulled from your paycheck? Do you have direct deposit? Your original question has been answered, but I want to point out that you are making a misunderstanding.\n\nYou *owe* taxes on everything you make and *withhold* taxes throughout the year. When you file your *tax return*, you are figuring out if you paid the appropriate amount. You either receive a *refund* (if you withheld too much), or pay the difference (if you under-withheld).\n\nSo your situation is that you underwithheld. Just saying that you owe X on your tax return isn't the whole story.\n\nNo matter what, **file your tax return on time and pay as much as you can**. The IRS will contact you about paying the remainder and you can get on a payment plan. It will be OK. But **MAKE SURE YOU FILE ON TIME EVEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY RIGHT NOW**. If you never paid any taxes (As your w2 is showing), then you owe those taxes now.  The 1200 comes out to around 10% which seems very reasonable given your income. \n\nYou are going to have to pay the money one way or another, so you might need to start talk to the IRS about a payment plan. \n\nOr see if the Bank of Mom and Dad can loan you the money.  Since the answer is already here I'd just recommend the next time you have to do adult stuff like fill out a W-4, ask for help unless you're 100% sure of what you're doing. There's no shame in it. No one is born knowing how to navigate things like taxes. We all had to learn from somewhere. I'm sure there are many around you who could help you out. The very last place I'd recommend you turn to is the internet, but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do.  All of the other answers here are fully sufficient. I'll add to an unrelated tidbit, only because you included it in your edit: Paying for \"half of my schooling myself out of a 529 account\" that (likely) **your parents funded** doesn't preclude them from being able to claim you. The IRS doesn't give a damn about that when they are making a determination of whether or not you can be claimed as a dependent. What did you put on your W-4? It should be Single 0 or 1. Yes- it sounds like you filled it out incorrectly. There is nothing you can do to avoid paying the taxes you owe.  Actually, I kind of wish this is how taxes were ALWAYS done. No witholding, ever. THEN, maybe people would appreciate and pay attention to the finer points of tax policy discussion.  This happened to me in 2015. I filled out the w4 wrong and selected EXEMPT. The W4 is very confusing if you don't know what you're reading. At the end of TurboTax it will let you choose the payment plan option. Unfortunately you have to pay it. Good luck!  As others have said, look into payment plan options with the IRS.  The interest rate is quite low, and you can work out a very reasonable monthly payment. Tell your parents to pay it\n\nThey are getting way more then $1,000, by claiming you as a dependent \n\nAnd do the damm-dishes  Go back and look at your pay stubs. Do you see money coming out for taxes? No? Well that's why you owe them now. Talk with whom ever is claiming you as a dependant and see if their break is more than yours. I say this because my father claimed me as a dependant until I was 24(I was in college living on campus). He convinced me it's better. Turns out it's much better for him, saved him 2k+ but since I was low income, paying student loan interest and other things, my refund would have been bigger than his deduction.  My wife got a w2 from her job... And for $16k of income, $195 was withheld federally. We are trying to figure out why. That just seems excessively low.  She had selected 1 exemption but we got married this year so her paperwork was filed as single.  Same thing happened to me, make $12.5k and owe $640. They took out only about a dollar a paycheck in federal tax. I don't know why. > I don't have that money and my job is seasonal and doesn't start until March.\n\nYou're in luck then.  You don't have to file/pay your taxes until April 15. You have until April 15th to save the money and pay your tax bill\n\nIf you cannot pay the money go ahead and file your taxes without it and then wait until you either get a letter or wait perhaps two to three months and then call the IRS and enter into a payment plan\n\nThey will accept a literally anything you can pay per month and for $1,000 it will not take you too long to pay them\n\nLesson learned the hard way, it's okay\n\n$1,000 isn't so bad and now you know how taxes work Because you didn't pay federal tax during the year, that's why.   Why aren't public schools teaching kids how to take care of their taxes. As you can tell op has no idea of how the tax system works and is now starting his/her working life in debt and once you get in debt with the IRS it's a bitch to dig your way out.  Did you give your employer a W-4 when you started working?  If you did then I'd seriously go through your pays tubs and make sure you got paid properly every week.\n\nThings are seriously shady... did your employer withhold the proper SS/Medicare amounts (and their half?). First, obviously fix your W-4 so you are having taxes withheld going forward. I'll also add this as a thought. Since your parents are claiming you as an exemption they are likely benefiting more by that than what you owe in taxes. Ask if going forward they would prefer to pay your taxes for you, or would prefer to drop you as an exemption. I did this when my kids worked part time jobs as it was more to my benefit to claim them as exemption (because my tax bracket was higher) than for them to pay their own taxes.\n You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Tax Software Megathread](http://redd.it/5ohy01)\n- [Taxes wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)\n- [Understanding tax brackets](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes#wiki_eli5.3A_taxable_income.2C_tax_brackets.2C_marginal_tax_rates)\n- [W-4 IRS Withholding Calculator](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* Any chance you put EXEMPT on your w2? You need to speak with your employer about changing your W-4. Make sure it is set to 0 and not 1 in box 5. My guess is it is set to 1 and not 0. If by chance it is set to 0 and they aren't taking taxes out you can have an additional amount withheld on each check in box 6. You can roughly calculate this based on how much you owe this year divided by number of pay checks you receive and round it up slightly for padding.\n\nFor this year I would speak to your parents about it and see if they can help you at all. You can also make payments to the Federal gov't for owed taxes.  Yeah you are going to owe this year since you did not have taxes whithheld and since someone else is claiming you as a dependent they get your personal exemption and not you.  Have you talked to your employer? Maybe it's a misprint. Also, your employer may be scamming you. The employer from my first job did withholding throughout the year, but when we got our W-2 forms they only showed a fraction of what was actually withheld.  They had sold the business and skipped town, so there wasn't much we could do. Fortunately for me I made so little I ended up not owing more than they reported. Others where not as fortunate. I'm gonna take a wild guess and assume you put something on your W-4 other than zero or even did actually put exempt. \n\nAlso when you were getting paychecks did you not wonder why you weren't seeing taxes being taken out or assume you were getting away with something? I didnt read any of the comments but the solution is simple.\n1ST: You are being claimed, this disqualifies you from claiming a personal exemption.\n\n2nd: You overlooked your W-4. You're probably claiming too many dependants and not having federal taxes withheld. Shit, you didn't pay taxes buddy. I did 10k in 4 months as I just started and let them take the max amount, around 2.1k. Let me know how it goes, I'm new to taxes. > Editing to add that while I live with my parents, I pay for half of my schooling myself out of a 529 account in my name.\n\nWho's paying the other half? My guess is you filled out the w-4 out wrong.  I was sent to the  backpage tables for the first time this year and it messed with mine (doubt this is your problem tho) \n\nI don't think there were any mid-year tax changes. usually if your +- 1k your in the correct ballpark.  \n\nYour parents shouldn't be claiming you if you are making more than 5k  a year, paying them rent, paying for your car insurance, etc... (health insurance is different) Your  not being a burden at that point and they are really hurting you to make up for their own tax mistakes. \n\ncall your county and see if they  know of free professional tax help, you might has some deductions worth looking for.  Have you done state yet? sometimes if you are lucky the state will swing the other way.  It seems like someone told you when you first started working that if you claimed a bunch of dependants, you would get more money every paycheck. The result being, you never had a cent taken out during the year to cover taxes, now you owe all of it at once. This crap happened to me on my first internship, for some reason the accountant filed tax exempt when I certainly wasn't. That was a tough tax year, nothing to do but pay the taxes you owe and fix it for next year. $1K is a mix of fed and state tax right?  A quick run through a 1040ez shows a fed tax of $473.  The rest must be state tax.  $11k income, claimed by someone else, no other income or deductions, no fed/state withheld.  You should adjust your W4 next year and have money withheld - it helps avoid your current situation.  I don't think there is anything you can do to avoid paying, but you do have until mid-April to send the forms and money. If I can add something, you can wait until closer to tax day in April to file since your job starts back in March. This will give you a couple checks to save and pay for it.  You paid $0 in taxes on $11k in income and now you want to know why you're being asked to pay a measily 10% in taxes?  Your parents are getting a fat return because of you, tell them to pay it.

You're already on the right path!\n Congrats on the great work thus far!\n\nDo you have an emergency fund?\nIf not, making one that can last you 3-6 months should be on the priority list.\n\nYou shouldn't have to do anything special to keep your score high, decreasing your utilization by paying off the card is helping already.\n\nIf not already you should put enough into your 401k to get the full employer match, whatever amount that is. anyone know where to find a card with no transfer fee and 0% APR for one year? Cause that's exactly what I need to do to pay off this remaining $2000 of credit card debt. I'm in a very similar situation to OP with crap income and am struggling to pay off this one card. Keep the cards open and don't spend what you couldn't afford to pay in cash at that moment.\n\nWant to buy a new TV, laptop, etc? Save up. Put it on the card for the extra protection, but be sure to pay the full balance by the due date. > How do I keep my credit score as high as possible?\n\nby doing what you're already doing, handling your money properly, consistently putting money into your existing loans to pay those down and not getting yourself into more debt\n\nif you ask around here about credit cards, the general consensus advice is to use it as if it were a debit card, i.e. only put on the card what you currently have available in your bank account to pay for (i.e. if you have 300 dollars in your account, don't go buying a new 500 dollar laptop or something)\n\na REALLY good strategy that is in line with that is if you aren't already doing so, take some time to learn how to budget money.  Personally I use a software called YouNeedABudget where the essential idea is, you take the money in your account and budget it for different categories.  Because it's based SOLELY on what's in your bank account, you'll know immediately if you have the money available to pay for it because it's a matter of looking at a category and seeing if there's still money available in that category.  So even if i'm putting that spending on my credit card, like say i'm eating at a restaurant, I know I have the money available for it.\n\nAs a side note, because of that, i can actually just set all my credit cards to autopay and never wonder/worry if i will overdraft my account, I can't because i know I will have enough in my account so long as i stick to the numbers in YNAB Remember how it felt when you were 13k in debt and felt like you wouldn't make it. Let that feeling drive your financial decisions. Heyo - good job! Today is my day where I am debt free. Same situation as you. Student after uni got debt almost the exact same amount actually. Before you get to your deadline make sure to make a new budget so that you don't just want to spend your extra money. Put money in emergency fund. I only browsed the responses below and didn't see this posted, but to answer your question on how to keep your credit score high after you pay the CC balances off DO NOT cancel/close any of the cards (as long as there is no annual fee). Simply stop using them. \n\nTwo things that banks look for are long periods of established credit and having credit available and not using it. Leaving the cards active, but not using them will achieve both. It seems counter intuitive, but banks are looking for people that have the ability to shoot themselves in the foot but never do versus not having the means to do so. It shows responsibility.  I just got a secured credit card through discover and I like it so far. It has an app. I use it to pay one bill a month that's about 20 dollars and don't max it out. I'm excited to see how it affects my score by this summer, it has already raised it. I was going to apply for a credit check this season, but they sent me one with my card so it saved me an application. :)\n\nMaintain spending. I recently stopped and looked at my spending, and cut out store-cupped coffees for me and my husband. It should save us about 600 dollars. I brew at home and use a shitty Ikea french press to foam milk and sugar if I'm feeling fancy.\n\nI also rebrokered my health insurance  yesterday and used the tax credit for preventative health care, so that my emergency fund won't get eaten by an unexpected bill. I am earning less than I did last year, so reapplying really helped. You're making more right now, but if anything changes let your health care provider know.\n\nBuild an emergency fund. The only way I made myself do it is by pretending every dollar I put aside I'm putting aside for a hobby business. It's really for if my car dies or if my cat needs to go to the vet on the same day, but I pretend it's for a restaurant I'm going to call RestaurAunts that staffs mostly elderly folk and has Golden Girls on TV. I'm literally in the same exact situation as you. Same age and everything. \n\nI would recommend emergency fund and depending on your employer retirement plan, contribute to a 401k. If you don't have that, open up a Roth IRA with Vanguard. Nice work!\n\n> What should I know going forward?\n\nIf you haven't yet, take a look at the flowcharts on the [wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and see where you're at. As many have said, you should start with an emergency fund.\n\n> How do I keep my credit score as high as possible?\n\nWhat's worked for me is to still use my cards, but pay off the entire balance every month and build up that history. Be wary of opening new cards and closing old ones because that affects the average age of your open accounts as well as other factors ([reference](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/credit-cards/buyers-remorse-credit-card/)).\n\nEdit: fixed my links How do you keep your credit score high? Don't default on payments and if you do make sure you follow up with the company right away to keep it off your record. wow that's really inspirational. Makes me feel like a real putz with my situation. I have  about 3200 in CC debt right now, split on 3 different cards ( 1300, 480, 540, and the balance on the one card I pay off every time-so something around those lines) \nI make close to 50k a year, and somehow I can't managed to get them to go away, but it sounds like getting one of those 12 month 0% cards, and consolidating may go a long way in helping bring it down pretty quickly-provided I can get a good budget down. \nSeriously, that's awesome and is really inspiring for me to get mine paid off come the summer! You should try to save enough money that if something happened, you have enough to cover everything for 1 year. That's the goal. Or at least 6 months. I personally keep our emergency fund at 1 year because if something did happen I could cut cost and stretch it to most likely a year and a half. I'm in a similar situation so I'll just piggyback here. I'm down to $4k in credit card debt, and I have $6k in my emergency fund.  Should I go ahead and pay off the CC with the emergency fund and immediately start to build the EF back up? Don't do it again. The end. You are WAY behind. Stay scared. IGNORE pop culture. Take up budget PC gaming (older games). That's a great time sink. Avoid women. ...emergency fund...start chipping away at the student loan debt...when you can, start contributing to a 401k. Good luck. How much did you pay off each month? Look up Dave Ramsey. It's a good system and can be tailored to your situation.  The real story here is how you \"paid as much as I could until the year was up\". \n\nThe difficulty lies therein.  World peace please\n\nOr free energy, education and finance for all.\n\n I'm in a similar situation but over $10k spread across multiple cards. Are you in the U.S.? I have no idea how you qualified for a card with such a high limit at a <20% APR, but I guess that's not the point. I can't for the life of me find a card with 0% and no transfer fee - all have a 3% transfer fee. My previous 0% promo rates are about to expire. I'm paying $800/month in CC bills as of last month trying to get the principal down but that interest is about  come crashing hard.\n\nAny advice? I paid all mine off a year ago...I had close to 16000 in cc debt at one point. Getting that last bill with a zero balance.....oooh yeah. Best feeling ever. Shred the credit cards first, only buy what you have cash for Um, have a beer? Don't know if anyone has said this yet, but don't forget to celebrate and have a favorite beverage or two.  Be proud, you will have achieved a goal.  Remember how good it feels. Save some money but start to spend on your health.  There is nothing more important in life then your \"container\" and you can make it last so much longer.

A good credit score is not about zero debt. You need a card that is reporting your regular usage and on time payments. That's at least part of it. I'm only 18 and still in high school and i find it really impressive for someone to manage paying off their credit card debt while only making ~30k/year. Nice job, keep up the good work. I fucked up in my teens / early 20's and I worked myself into quite the financial hole. With all the attorneys , court fees etc I'm looking at a whopping 15k. The IRS wants there money and I want them off my back but the weight of that much debt is a pretty heavy burden. I have two kids and a wife to be. You're story gave me a little bit of hope though. Thank you for that. Great work and solid diligence and discipline  Make yourself a really good omelet to celebrate. Throw in come chives, chervil, maybe a little bit of smoked back bacon.   > How do I keep my credit score as high as possible?\n\nTo me this is the wrong question. You should want financial stability, being debt-free or nearly-so, and having the resources to weather future unpredictable circumstances and be able to afford the things you need or want. A credit score is the banking industry's evaluation of you, and can be one helpful indicator of where you stand but should not be a goal unto itself. Credit scores mostly matter when you plan to borrow money, and once your debt is paid off your specific score will be important just a few times in your life, e.g. when you want to buy a house.\n\nIt sounds like you're doing a fantastic job of working towards financial stability, so congratulations! Your credit score of 749 is already good and it will improve over time. There's lots of good advice already in this thread (emergency fund), but it seems like you're already well on your way.\n Congratz on credit card debt. Now never let it happen again. I am 26 and have never paid a penny in interest to credit cards. My suggestion is to save up and go on a trip in a couple of months. Then start building wealth. It's the suckers who say things like \"can't take it with you so spend it while you got it\" .... if you learn basic fundamentals of investing, even just investing in simple ETFs, you can grow your money.  I was in your boat, my looming debt followed me for 25 years. I finally am about to clear mine off in 24 months and counting, knock on wood. once I do, I am quitting my day job, and will run a charity and do volunteer work from then on out. will work part time to pay my electric bill for shelter. and some organic produce.\n\nconsumerism and money, has spoiled my appetite to ever care to earn more than necessary.\n\nthough my situation was not from overspending, it was health related at a young age, preventing me from full time work, and loss of insurance claim, due to exclusion, though I won that $25K settlement in court (10 years after)(and 6K lawyer fee)\n\n Just keep paying your bills on time.  Your credit score will be fine. whats next? pay my debts off now.  No advice here, but many kudos to you for putting yourself on the line for your future. Well done. Start saving up that 6 month emergency fund as you pay off the rest.    > How do I keep my credit score as high as possible?\n\nKeep your current cards open and do not open new ones.  Time is your friend.  Also slowly ask for an increase in the limit on your primary card, but make sure to set up alerts to more closely monitor for fraudulent activity.   Awesome work getting the debt down!!!! Cut up the cards and live mainly by your debit card only!  Keep one of the credit cards though in case of emergencies only Once you've payed off that CC, keep putting the same amount into an emergency fund. You won't miss the money, and you'll be able to keep yourself out of a hole in the future. \n\n\n Well this makes me feel good about my 3.5k credit card debt that seems like it's taking forever to pay off even though half of my paychecks are going towards paying it off Drew? I feel like you may be my co worker  pay your bills on time How does one get a credit card with 0% when they're maxed out on their card?  Never worked for me... Usually student loan rates are ridiculous, so i would take out another loan with a lower rate to pay down the student loan faster. Other than that, keep your credit card utilization below 30%, pay on time and you should be fine Focus on improving yourself and finding ways to increase income. Stash some money and assorted assets for a rainy day. Put your money towards things you value and are important aspects of being human. Pay off your loan. I don't know what you're really looking for; the specifics are up to the individual.  Get rid of the cards. Forever. Noob question: Does transferring to a new card close the old one? I would hate to lose the 10 years of credit history I have on my current card. Also, what is the incentive for the banks if you're just going to transfer a large sum of money, never pay interest on it, and never pay a transfer fee? Are they hoping you'll keep the card past the 0% APR period?  As others have stated, emergency fund is next. This should be 3-6 months worth of minimal expenses. Dave Ramsey and others would suggest an alteration to this where you save a mini emergency fund of about $1000, then go right into your student loans. The advantage to going with a small emergency fund is that you can get right back to paying off debt which you have been doing so well for so long with you CC's. if you really dig in and focus on those student loans you'll be completely debt free before you know it. The con to this method is that an incomplete emergency fund will not be enough to cover long term unemployment or serious medical or unexpected maintenance bills. \n\nIt comes down to a personal choice--that's why it's called personal finance. Do you want to feel more secure in an emergency, or get out of debt faster? Just want to say congratulations! I paid off my student loan today and can't stop smiling. Hope you're very proud of your work to pay off your loans.  Take 80% of what you were paying and put it towards savings. Put the leftover 20% towards your every day use.\n\nI've always heard people say, as your income increases, keep your cost of living close to the same.  Tl;dr. Find the cheap money. If you are paying 10% interest and can transfer to 3 or 0% do it. Find accounts that pay more. My checking pays 1% with direct deposit and 10 debit transactions/month. Check out R/personalfinance and r/churning more free money.  Get an emergency fund too. Very important.  Celebrate in some way. (but don't charge the party to your credit card) Keep your credit cards open, do not close them, it will hurt your score if you close them, even with a $0 balance  [removed] I can think of but one way to celebrate: a $13k free Crack giveaway! If you don't have a credit card u can't have a credit score #justsaying I'm in the exact scenario you were in. \n\nShould I make a post for assistance?  This post is such great motivation! I'm in the process of paying down my post college credit card debt too and it is overwhelming. Is there anything that helped you besides the 0% interest credit cards?\n Check out Dave Ramsey, so much good info and guidance! Well, simply put, this is a big accomplishment and you should feel like a huge weight has been lifted. Extremely impressive that you have kept a 749 credit score throughout.\n\nAt 0% on your cc debt, you could actually start paying down the student loans first. Could definitely simplify things and keep your focus straight dealing with the rest of the cc debt first though. \n\nOnce you clear all debt save up 3 months or so worth of all expenses, and then start investing as much as possible. That's all there is to it. Don't get another credit card? Get a new job that pays even more! A lot people clear it out that way. I haven't transferred any balances but I keep opening new 0% APR credit cards when I can expect a massive cost, like my wife's uninsured dental work(over 3k, paid off with 0 interest) or my wedding (opened a couple and spread out everything and paid it off last year, again at 0% interest). I've got two more offers expiring in May with 18 and 21 months of 0% APR siitting on my table and currently have 700ish on another 0% card until some time next year. I've cleared over 16k of student debt since I started working last year thanks to these as I don't have to pay the full amount off each month and I never let it get beyond what I make in a paycheck.\n\nMy advice is probably just echoing everyone else's. Build up a 6 month or more safety net. Pay off other debts that have interest. Contribute to a 401k or other retirement plan. Try to enjoy life within your means.  https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4tlqsd/eli22_personal_finance_tips_for_older_young/ Can someone explain to me how someone with 13k in debt can still have a good credit score? I thought if you had more than 10% utilization, or had not paid down balance monthly your score would drop hundreds in time?  Have you considered working as a teacher for a couple years to get rid of those student loans? I hear there's a program that will forgive your loans if you teach at a public school for a certain amount of time. And you could even end up making more than 35k a year. Now save $13k. It's always been said. If you finish paying off an extended loan,  open up a savings account and pay the exact same amount into that.

What was the process like to transfer your debt to another card? Like can I call my bank and they will do it over the phone? only use your credit card when you are making big purchases, like kitchen appliances and other furniture. also, even if it's a really good deal, don't open store credit cards, as this can negatively affect your credit score. also, if you can, pay your credit card in full and then some. if you just pay the minimum, the interest will probably be really bad. Pretend your still making payments on your credit cards but divert that money into a Roth IRA. Diversify your dividends into a portfolio based on the NASDQ.

You could find your soulmate in the Ohio sticks for all I know. You really have to be honest with yourself and think about what you are actually going to do with the extra money. Are you going to be bored out of your mind all alone and end up spending it on booze, online entertainment or other things to make you happy? Also how bad is the commute from your job now and this new place? If you have to add in a long drive that adds dollars and time to your monthly expenses. Also are you going to actually see 150% more? If you are going to get paid more, first do the taxes; Ohio might have different taxes than what you are used to if you aren't already in the state. Then do all of your commuting math and consider the local sales taxes, car registration, insurance cost difference and all of that. If you are going to be able to save...maybe 50% more than what you can now I'd say do it. (I had a friend move from Ohio...she makes the same base pay in my state yet take home pay is nearly double because we have significantly less taxes in the state.)\n\nI actually moved to a much more expensive area because in the sticks I spent my money on all kinds of junk killing time trying to find something to do.

I was making 30k a year in CT, moved to NYC and now I am making 65k doing the same job. Depends on where in Ohio.  Southwest (Near Cincinnati Metro), Northeast (near Cleveland) or Central (near Columbus) are okay areas even in more rural locations.  You will be close to relatively active urban areas.  I would avoid like the plague Southeast OH, it's a heroin wasteland or Toledo which is very depressed economically.\nI would take the job, work for a few years then get the hell out. I wish we could move but that ship has sailed.\nEdit for silly mistake When you make more money you find more ways to spend it. As long as you're sure you can stay disciplined and save the surplus then I would probably do it. Making a sacrifice like this can really give you a leg up.

I live in a tiny country called Seychelles which has cca 90,000 people. With such little real estate about, you can imagine that the price of land is quite high.

I drive a 2007 Saturn Ion. 4 door sedan, about 138,000 miles on it. Due to the damage done by the other driver, the body shop notes that repairs to be done to the back left rim above the wheel needs replaced and the back left door needs some work. Everything is in working condition for now, I was only planning on using the car for about 1-2 more years. But the repair costs are estimated to be about 2,000 dollars.\n\nI went to edmunds and kelley blue book, my car is estimated to have a trade in value of about $750 dollars. Perhaps even less with this damage now. My question is, if the repair bill is 2,000, and if they are offering me $900 cash to just forgive the accident and not get insurance involved, should I just take the cash?\n\nThanks for any help", "title": "Not at fault car accident, people are offering money to not get insurance involved", "comments": "That's a bad deal.  If they give you $900 you don't have enough to fix your car and you don't have enough to buy a new car.  If you were to buy one of those it wouldn't be the trade-in value, you'd pay the private party seller value which will be significantly more.  \n\nAlso any time you don't get the police/insurance company involved, you run the risk of them calling their insurance company later on and saying you hit their car.  Now it's your word against theirs and they have a head start. \n\nIn general, always get a police report so you can prove what happened, and always contact their insurance company so you can get paid.  You're not obligated to do them any favors, they hit you, they need to make things right.\n\n No insurance is ever going to pay for $2k in repairs on a $750 car. \n\nSo, the big thing is can you prove they are at fault? If so, their insurance covers the lot. Which means you would be better going through insurance. Doubly so if there is any chance of injury. \n\nOn the other hand, that $900 is going to be more than you will get from the insurance company for your car. \n\nReally, I think you should go through insurance. They don't want you to because it is not in their best interests. You stand to lose out by not informing them of the accident in any future accidents, insurance will cover *everything* like the costs of transport while you are without a car and as I said, injuries.  Your car is worth more than $750. You need to be looking at the retail value, not trade-in value. Tell them they need to front the full repair bill, or no dice. Their current offer is a low-ball. You have the upper hand in this *negotiation*. Any car that runs is worth at least $1500, don't shortchange yourself.  If you are willing to continue using the vehicle without the repairs, just keep in mind that this will likely shorten the cars lifespan. So starting saving for the next one now.   Okay,  this point of view is based on family owning a body shop. If there's nothing mechanic in bad shape,  you might as well get the cash. \n\nIf you were planning on replacing the car anyways,  the cash will be better used if saved rowards the next car you get.  My family always just pays cash or fixes the damage if they are involved in an accident because at the end it's cheaper than dealing with insurance and it adds up against the policy cost, so they aren't necessarily trying to scam you. \n\nI would suggest you check with your insurance because there's plenty of companies out there that will damage your record or even increase the price without caring if you're at fault or not. \n\nDo you really want to get a $2000 amount of work in a car that might be in it's last leg? \nDon't listen about the car being totaled.  It won't happen because the car is functional and $2000 of work isn't extravagant.  Actually,  that's kind of low compared to a bad accident. \n\nOf course,  take the advice, carefully.  Where was your car hit?  Near the engine?  Might want to be careful then.  Check with your insurance how long you have to report an accident.  (Actually,  check with the other part's insurance.  Hopefully you got the info). I'll let you know that if the police officer didn't give you any paperwork,  he might have been under the impression that you were going to settle with the other party and he probably didn't write a report  but in most towns you can just walk into the police station of the town where the accident happened to request one.  You can give the insurance company\"comparable\" market values to replace. This has more miles and is listed at almost $7k. If you can show other ions for sale at this price. This is \"replacement market value.\"\nhttps://www.cars.com/vehicledetail/detail/691998488/overview/ > my car is estimated to have a trade in value of about $750 dollars\n\nThis is immaterial.\n\nYou aren't trading in the car. Book it out at full retail value, as that's the amount YOU would have to pay in order to replace it. Insurance will only pay out the total loss value of the car which is very close to the blue book value of the car, but not the same.\n\nIf the other driver's are offering $900 and your kbb estimation puts the car at $750, it's not a bad idea to consider taking the cash. You can buy a new tires and rims and pocket the rest as long as you don't mind driving a car with some flaws in the body work. (Don't drive around with bent rims, seriously.)\n\nPersonally, I'd ask for an even $1,000 cash and pocket the money after replacing your tire/rim.\n\nMy 2 cents. I don't know if you've gotten any help but I was rear ended once and the other guy had no insurance, called the cops and all they did was give him a ticket for no insurance .... I had to just accept his money and of course it wasn't enough to fix anything much, I had to end up doing most of my own work and what not ... I would say get the insurance involved ...  dude i am in the exact same situation as you when it comes to a car.\n\nits busted up, i took the cash, drive around in this dented car but everything on the inside works fine. gets me from point a to point b no issues.\n\nsaving up cash to buy a new car. I'd say counter at like $1100, get the rim repaired, leave the dent in the back door. NADA is what most insurance companies use to decide the value of a vehicle. Check it out: http://www.nadaguides.com/Cars/2007/Saturn/Ion-4-Cyl/Sedan-4D-ION-2/Values\n\nIn this case, you could probably get the average trade in value for it. You could also tell them you want to keep the car, so you lose maybe $500 or so, but that's $1000 you put in your pocket. Basically only a little bit more than what those people are offering you, for a lot more trouble. That being said, sometimes you can get lucky with insurance companies. Did you go to the hospital or anything after the incident? Insurance companies will usually pad their offer so that you will waive your rights to sue for additional medical costs down the road. \n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention that if you did take the insurance money, and keep the car, the title would be amended to reflect its new SALVAGE status. This could make it difficult to get insurance on it. If the trade in value is $750, and there is $2000 worth of damage, the insurance company is just going to say that your car is totaled and give you the $750.\n\nIf the car is still operational and the only real damage is cosmetic, you can just take the money, not fix the car, and drive around with a banged up side panel for the next 1-2 years.  I would still get the police report though even if you do this so you have a paper trail of who was actually at fault. I would say no deal. You should get replacement cost. To get the official number call your insurance company and just ask what a total car payout would be. I am looking on Cars.com and the cheapest ones I see are 2k. So, I am thinking you try to get 2k and get something new. You could take the cash then go to CarMax. My BF did that and got $500 for the car after a fender bender so the car wasn't worth much. \nCar insurance will not pay $2000.\nAlso, they might not have insurance which is why they're asking.\nMy insurance company also said if you don't use them, then make sure you get something signed that they can't sue you for anything else after the fact. Make sure it states the vehicles involved, the people, that there were no physical injuries and the pay out amount. Craigslist has a bunch of Saturn IONs 2004-2006 for close to $2000.  You could get more than $900.\n From my perspective, the OP has some negotiating power... If you do not think $900 is enough money, ask for more. If they are unwilling to give you more, then get insurance involved. \n\nThey already showed their hand. Negotiate to get what you feel is reasonable or get insurance involved.  I am no lawyer nor I play one on the internet, but... is that even legal.\n\nIf not illegal, it's just not *correct*, and by doing so you associate and affiliate with the other party, you're doing them a favor (I am sure they have reasons) and.. what do **you** get?\n\nWhat if they dick you around for a week or 10 days and then they can't come up with the money, they give you a check for 1/2 and than it bounces.\n\nAt that point you are, again, associated and affiliated with them; with little recourse and for sure very little sympathy if you were to then want to file a claim with your insurance.\n\nYou're in the right, you don't know these people and you owe them nothing.  File with your insurance and let the system take care of things. I would take the cash. The insurance company will just total out the car and offer 750-1200. I'd try to get the at fault party up to 1200, replace the rim and drive around with the dent for as long as you can until you get a new car. \n\nSource: I appraise cars for a living Having gone through an almost identical situation when I was in college, I would counter with asking for $1200. Take the money fix the bare minimum and pocket the rest for a nice start to your next vehicle.  When I was in college I had the same thing happen. A driver pulled out in front of me and hit me. 100% his fault. He offered to give me $1000 to not file a claim. After seeing the $2300 repair bill, I thought that was a bad deal. I filed a claim, they totaled my car and I received $900 ('91 sentra w/ 230k in 2008). So I actually got $100 less and now I had no car, because the insurance company comes and takes it after paying you.  Might as well take the cash and get a newer car.  \n\nIf your car was newer then I would say go through insurance.  My rule of thumb is that once repairs go above and beyond the value of the car, its time to get a new car. [deleted] Probably should take the cash.  \n\nInsurance is not going to pay $2k in repairs for a $750 car.  They will charge you whatever your deductible is and then total your car. Id take the $900 if your car is only worth $750 like you say. Even if insurance is involved the max they will pay you out is $750 and on top of that they will take the car unless you take less money to keep it(usually how much a salvage yard will give you is what they take if you keep it which is like $200-300)If you take the $900 instead you can decide if you want to fix it with your own money, or if you want to scrap it and get alittle more money and then buy a new car. It seems the $900 is better since you can scrap it also and get another $200-300 for a new car.

Buying and selling a house means paying a lot of transaction costs, and you don't ever get that money back.\n\nFor example, when I bought my house I had to pay 1% the value of the house in transfer taxes to the city, plus $600 for a home inspection, $200 to the brokerage, $500 for the home appraisal required by my lender, a few hundred in assorted mortgage origination fees, a few hundred in assorted legal fees, and about $1500 for the required title insurance.  In total, I paid something like $5-6k in closing costs just to buy my house, and I'll never get that money back.  \n\nWhen you sell a house you don't have to pay for all of the mortgage fees or a home inspection, but sellers in my area do have to pay the 1% transfer tax, plus whatever commissions are due to the involved real estate agents.  In most cases, the seller pays both agent commissions, and that can add up to 5-6% the sale price of the house.  \n\n\nIf you buy a house for $100k, you might pay $3-5k in closing costs, then owe an additional $5-7k when you sell.

It does NOT apply if you sell the investment at a gain and immediately re-buy it. You can harvest gains. I think that might have been part of your source of confusion since you only pay capital gains taxes on gains, so it seems you would be wanting to harvest gains, not losses.

If you are asking when to pay the tax for your capital gain income, the answer is \"it depends\"...\n\nIf you can be covered by underpayment safe harbor, you can wait until April 15, 2018. In other words, it is okay to owe more than $1000 tax if you already paid at least as much as last year's tax liability by year end (along with other safe harbors).\n\nOtherwise pay by the estimated tax quarterly due date, which is April 17, 2017.

For me it would come down to whether I wanted to be invested in those securities specifically (in which case may as well hold them), or whether I'd rather use that money to invest in different funds or payoff high interest debt or what have you (in which case, sell them) If you're already paying a CFP for advise why not just call them?

Any thoughts would be much appreciated.", "title": "Renter's insurance and roommates", "comments": "Renters Insurance is just like car insurance.  If your name isn't on it, you get no benefit from it/are not liable for it.  Tell him to fuck off. There's a good summary here: https://www.effectivecoverage.com/3283/can-roommates-share-renters-insurance/. There is usually a process to add roommates to a policy (I have gone through it a few times and it's not hard), so if you're not on the policy, then it's on them. Counterargument would be that your landlord requires a renters insurance policy and that this person got one to \"cover the requirement\" but doesn't really understand that as you mentioned they are functionally covering themselves not each tenant. As far as I know most people only have renter's insurance for themselves, not their roommates. That said, coverage can vary and be applied to multiple people. But, this would be something your roommate discusses with you as to whether or not you want that. There are a few other considerations like sharing insurance claims (say something of his is damaged and he files a claim, it goes on your record too) or one person moving out before the other. He can't just demand money from you without a discussion. Er, if you have your own policy just tell him to fuck off. Even if he did have a policy that covers you, which I've never heard of, you don't need it. You're paying for your own. He's either trying to scam you, or doesn't understand how renters insurance works. I believe that your renter's insurance only covers you and his would only cover him, unless there is a relative.  My renter's insurance policy names me and my spouse, but also covers our child.  \n\nYears ago, a couple of friends and one of the friend's sisters rented a 3 bedroom apartment.  The apartment had an electrical fire and there was quite a bit of damage.  My 2 friends both had insurance, friend's sister did not.  Friend's insurance ended up covering sister because they were related. Unless you agreed upon it beforehand, you don't owe him anything. End of story.  [deleted] > ...and that we all owe him for the past months he's paid it.\n\n\"Ah, yes, well...remember that time you rode in my car? I'll expect a check to help cover my insurance for the past six months.\"\n\nSeriously, this person needs a reality check. Life doesn't work that way. Obviously he should've brought this up when he wanted to start the insurance.\n\nI don't see how he could possibly expect you to pay if you've never discussed it before, but you should find out answers to the following questions:\n\n- does your lease require you to have a renter's insurance policy?\n- do any of the other 3 roommates have their own policies?\n- are you all listed as \"Named Insured\" on the policy in question, or just the guy who signed up for it?\n- how much is he paying? In my experience, renter's insurance is dirt cheap, especially if you combine it with an auto policy.\n- are the coverage limits sensible given your ages / possessions?\n\nIf you guys can all split a $80/year policy or something I would say it's probably worth it, despite this guy's casual attitude about bills. Of course that assumes that the policy will cover you all (sometimes insurance companies are weird about adding non-related roommates). Unless you are specifically a named beneficiary on that account you are not going to be covered and the room mate needs to gtfo with that BS.  Read his policy and contact his insurance agent to see if you guys are covered under his policy.\n\nIf it does, then agree to pay a share going forward, but he's on his own for the past months. 1) Is it a single lease for the house or do you lease the rooms individually?\n\n2) Regardless, you have your own insurance and did not authorize him to buy any on your behalf so you don't owe him anything. ya don't pay him even if you are included in the rental insurance. If someone did this on my behalf without consulting me first I wouldn't pay for it. It's on him for not discussing this with you beforehand. My renter's insurance is through USAA.\n\nWhen I started the policy, I was told that it only applied to my possessions (whether on the rental property or not - my policy covers storage units as well), but they would cover a \"significant other or family member\" if we cohabitated. My roommate's possessions are not covered, unless I lie (commit insurance fraud) and say she's my girlfriend. \nIt seems like the only way you would get anything out of your roommate's insurance is some sort of fraud, unless you are directly named on the policy. So there should be no question about you owing money for the policy; it's not your stuff that's being insured. Thanks a ton everyone, I appreciate all the help, I definitely got all the information I need. I will not be paying him anything!  First step. read his policy.   Sounds like your question has been pretty much answered, but I thought I'd weigh in. I've been in insurance for quite some time, and work for a big-name company. Our renters policy only extends coverage for a 'resident relative or spouse'. My guess is his policy wouldn't do anything for you in the event of a loss. You don't owe him for a policy that provides you with no coverage... ask him to show you where you signed on to his policy and how you are covered. He won't be able to and you can tell him to fuck off and not ask you for money he spent without getting the ok from you first ever again.  He's scamming. Move out.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* Can you immediately sell the ESPP with no waiting period? If so you absolutely want to max out ESPP and then use the money to pay off debts. See j__h's comment first.  If you do need to hold stock, then:\n\nLooks like the Chase rate is so high that it's more valuable to pay it off than to take the 'free' money of the ESPP.  Amex is pretty close too.  So I think it makes sense pay those off first, then use your current strategy on the rest. Take the ESPP \"bonus\" money and use it to pay down the debts faster. The balances on the two credit cards with the highest interest rate are so low that you should be able to pay them off almost immediately.\n\nA 15% discount on a $9k contribution (10% of 90k) would mean that you could benefit up to $1350 each year from the discount alone.\n\nHere's an imperfect simplification of the math:\n\nIf you sell every 3 months, you'd have lost access to $750/mo that you could have used sooner to pay down the debt but gained $112.50/mo from the discount. Assuming that you would have used this money to pay down the highest interest rate CC first, consider the 15.5% to be 1.29% monthly. You'd pay 1.29% on each $750 for each month that it's in the ESPP ($9.68/mo). The compound interest formula works too. The first $750 is held up for all three months, the second $750 for 2 months, and the third $750 for one months so $9.68*3+$9.68*2+$9.68 or just $9.68*6. Using the compound interest formula, that's just under $59 in interest over the 3 month holding period. At the end of that period you're ahead by $337.50 from the discount. You'd pay around $59 to gain $337.50.\n\nSo instead of using that $2250 to pay down the debt over 3 months, you can now pay 2528.5 every 3 months.\n\nThe math only gets more favorable once you kill the highest interest debt and move to the next.

I don't have a ton of money with Betterment, but I am disappointed so far. Considering how much the market has run up, my overall return is about 1.5% on what small amount I've invested with them. Maybe I'm doing it wrong.  I guess I just don't get the appeal. Is Betterment really a significant benefit over low-cost Vanguard index funds, or even the target date retirement fund? Maybe I don't understand. I don't use Betterment for retirement, but I'm using it for a mid-range savings in the hopes of getting some decent returns over a typical savings account. I still think it's a good tool for that despite the fees. My retirement account is elsewhere. Not too surprising. Entice you with low teaser rates to get you into the service, then jack up rates after the switching costs become high for you. Many software services have been following this model for years now. With Charles Schwab you can move your entire portfolio out of Betterment without cashing it out.\nI'm sure other brokerages are also capable of doing this.

This discussion has mostly focused on larger portfolios and the costs incurred over a long period.  How about for a young person who does not have access to a 401K or an open IRA nor the capital to open a Vanguard account (this is not my situation; I'm an old fart).  \nWouldn't Betterment be a great vehicle for someone getting started in retirement savings who has the goal to move to a Vanguard fund in the future after enough capital has accumulated?

Mortgage lenders verify income using tax summaries, not bank statements. Bank statements are only used to show that you have money for a down payment.\n\nAll you will be able to provide is your $1,100/mo gross income (assuming $1.1k), which would qualify you for a mortgage of roughly $308/mo. If you can find a home that would result in that kind of mortgage, then you're in good shape. If it costs any more, you are not getting a loan.\n\nYour wife needs to report her income. Not only is it illegal, it is also shortsighted not to do so. Social Security will still be around in some form when you retire, and the calculation is based on your highest 35 years of work. Every year your wife works under the table is one less year of income for Social Security. Further, without a verifiable employment history, it will be incredibly difficult to qualify for any kind of financing. If she doesn't report her pay for 2016, then she'll have a real hard time getting credit before mid-2018. any lender will request W2s...and 1040s...so nope...you can't show variable income Your wife will need to report her income and pay taxes in order for the two of you to qualify for a mortgage based on your combined income.\n\nWorking under the table is tax fraud, and tax fraud is a really bad idea.   Money showing up in your account without a paper trail is considered a gift that needs to be repaid. It adds to your funds, but also your debt when looking at homes you can afford. In the old days you would just say that you were self-employed. This would qualify you for a more risky (higher interest) sub-prime loan. Since that collapse, banks shy away from those loans. What you should do is pay your taxes (as an independent contractor), and use the tax return as proof of income. If its under the table it all depends on the amount made.\n\nSelf Employment\u00a0tax\u00a0(Scheduled SE) is generated if a person has $400 or more of net profit from self-employment on Schedule C. You pay 15.3% for 2014 SE\u00a0tax\u00a0on 92.35% of your Net Profit greater than $400. The 15.3% self employed SE\u00a0Tax\u00a0is to pay both the employer part and employee part of Social Security and Medicare.\n\nIf you both file the taxes she will need a Misc-1099 and if you have kids then it can mitigate some of the amount due from her taxes. Usually loan companies and banks require that you show Tax forms for proof of income. Bank statements alone won't be enough for some. Also see what your wife spent on gas, supplies, and such even clothing and clothing care products are deductibles if it was used for work. Equally true for cell phones. Hope that helps. Lenders require paystubs, earnings statements, and copies of your tax documents to verify all income claimed. There used to be no-income-documentation loans (colloquially named \"liar loans\") where you could just state your income without providing any proof, but the 2007-2008 crash more or less put a stop to that. Lenders also tend to prefer that you've been at your current job at least two years; they're very hesitant to approve mortgages when you just got a shiny new job at a much higher income than you previously made until you've been there long enough that they think it's not just a flash in the pan.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* Most here would say the avalanche would be a better way, and they would be right.  Avalanche you pay the most towards the loan with the highest interest rate first.\n\nPersonally, since I am on a IDRP, I am using the snowball because I want to make the split up payments take bigger chunks out of the larger loans.  Why?  Because at the payment the larger loans are getting right now my balance is going up rather than down even though I'm repaying, and the interest rates are so close it's not a huge deal.  So I plan to knock out a few of the smaller balance ones first, then go to the avalanche method on the highest interest.\n\nFinancially, you will always be better off with the avalanche method.  The snowball is usually only better if you aren't good with money. What point are you at in your life right now?\n\nGraduated? Married? Looking to buy a house? Need a new car?\n\nYour percentages are ridiculously low. For comparison, my (20k in) loans are around 3.6% and I plan on paying the minimum for the full term. \n\nYes it would be nice to have one less payment, but you could be saving up for a downpayment on a house or a car, both of which will definitely have a higher interest rate. Well, avalanche doesn't apply here because the interest rates are the same.  But I would definitely start with the smallest loan.  Every time you get a loan paid off, that's another monthly payment you don't have, which you can shift over to your next smallest loan, repeat. I'm 36, married, own a home with a 15yr mortgage, financed my Highlander at 2%, and only have one credit card, my car note, and these loans.  I'm paying on them because I know that if I don't, it'll bite me in the butt.  I'm focusing on the credit card because it's at 9% with an 8k balance.  It's my last card and funds my 2 kids mostly.\n\nFinancially, I'm in great shape with a pension and savings (Thrift Savings).  I've always attacked more directly those items with higher interest (I used to have about 30k in credit cards alone...long story), and I never even considered my loans because the payment is so low and the APRs are all the same.\n\nI'm in the National Guard, so I have a tuition waiver for state-owned colleges, so I'm working on my second FREE masters, and I got my first one for under $1k in books and fees.  As a result, my loans have been in deferment since 2010 because I'm in school.  As I said, I pay because these things are lingering like an STD!!!  See below for why it's been 14 years and I STILL have loans...\n\nOn a side note:  when I graduated college in 2003, I was waiting tables with a LOW declared income.  Dept of Ed set me up with an income based payment plan.  When I got bought by Ed Financial, they rolled my plan in and locked my payments in at the current rate and set a date for payoff.  No one has any idea how I managed to keep my payment plan without ever once verifying income after the plan was established.  I'm apparently a glitch in the system, and I've been told by Ed not to rock the proverbial boat.  I graduated with almost $30k in debt and my monthly payment is $209.  And has been since 2003.  I'm now in a financial place to finally pay them off once my last credit card is gone.  Frustratingly...I could qualify for forgiveness if I had been on a verified financial plan, but I currently make over $100k annually, so it would raise my payments to an obscene amount if I were to have them evaluated for a forgiveness.  I would also have to start over with a new verified ten year plan, and I hope to have them paid off in two.\n\nSorry for the length, but I get a kick out of my anomaly. snowball is a mental gimmick, not a financial one.  I think its stupid :)\n\nso if all of your loans have the same rate, it really doesnt matter which you pay over on, its all the same difference.\n\nIf you want the mental kudos of paying off an account, target your overpayment to 1 loan at a time, smallest to largest, or whatever other order you like.

I'd lease.  Then you won't have to worry about selling when the 24 months is over, nor about the difficulties of being without a car for a week or two if it sells early.  We don't know enough about your situation to know if a family member or friend can manage selling the car for you after you've left.\n\nYou should be able to get a new car for $200 a month or less leased.  Also check out leasetrader, you can take over someone's lease.\n\nhttp://www.leasetrader.com/2016_Toyota_Corolla_L_248371.xhtml\n\n\nhttp://www.leasetrader.com/lease-in/Payment-To.299_Months-From.19_Months-To.26_S.Payment\n\nLike others said, just make sure you won't be exceeding the miles (usually $.15 for each mile over). For example, an extra 1000 miles would be $150.\n I leased for the first time last year because I wanted to get something cheap to bridge the game from my wife's old car while I saved for a nicer SUV for her (with the thought of kids coming).\n\nFound a 2016 Chevy Malibu lease for $75/mo., $0 down, and 15k miles a year.... because of this, I will always look at leasing prior to actually buying now.\n\nLeasing can be stuipd cheap if you hit the timing right.  I think right now you can get a Chevy Cruze for like $110/mo. with zero down and 15k miles. What is your budget? What can you afford to spend per month?\n\nYou can get fairly recent model cars, used, for 10 to 15k. Your monthly wouldn't be terrible (200 to 300/mo) and you'd be able to sell it when you are done with it.\n\nWith a lease you are limited in miles and you simply have to hand the keys over when you are done. This will also cost you 200 - 300, granted you'll have a newer car, but again, you get no money when you are done with it. You'll also have more warranty coverage, so I imagine that's something to consider. Although 200-300 may get you into a CPO in which case you'd have a decent warranty as well.\n\nBut before any of this, you are a first time car owner? How old are you? What sort of income do you have? Have you budgeted for this? In your situation I think it makes more sense to lease the car. Pay for whatever damage protection they offer so you won't be surprised by charges after your lease expires for little scratches and any other cosmetic damage. Make sure you get enough miles to cover your usage. You will basically be renting a car for two years. Buying will not save you money in only two years time. Plus leasing requires little, if any, cash up front. Balance the pros and cons of both sides.\n\n**Leasing**:\n\nPros: -You don't have to worry about maintenance(a big plus if you're a first time buyer) -you get to walk away at the end -you'll be in a much nicer and newer car than if you bought used\n\nCons: -Its expensive. Monthly payments plus you'll need full coverage insurance (which is a good idea anyway but can be expensive). - Mileage restrictions. If you go over your mileage it can get very expensive pretty quickly. Less expensive monthly payments generally come with lower mileage allowances. - You cant recoup any of your investment. Which is fine because you're paying for something that you need and you wont have to worry about the time or expense of selling it when you're finished. \n\n*Caveat: any dings or scratches are usually your responsibility at the end of the lease. Many dealerships will charge or will ask you to have them repaired (this is something worth knowing before you sign). If you own the car the dings and scratches will more than likely be deducted when you try and sell it.\n\n**Owning**\n\nPros: - You can sell the vehicle when you no longer need it. There is a possibility you'll be out of pocket $0 dollars at the end of 24 months. Though if its your first time buying or selling its a smaller possibility and it WILL take time and effort to sell.\n\nCons: - you are responsible for all maintenance. You'll more than likely need help with any trouble that may pop up. Paying someone to fix and maintain a vehicle can get expensive. However if you have the time learning to fix and maintain a vehicle can be very rewarding to the bank account and the soul. It generally comes down to how much you value your time. Also it should be noted that it is possible to buy a reliable used car with little worry of a breakdown in 24 months. \n\nThis is way too long, most likely way too pedantic, and most importably horribly formatted. But I tried my best and I hope it helps. Good luck with your decision! I would lease in your situation. Just get the most basic no-frills model you can find with low monthly payments I would personally look into buying a car a bit more for a couple of reasons:\n\nA) When you have the car you own the car. This can be good and bad for obvious reasons but at the end of the day, it is yours. So there is no obligation to fix cosmetic issues. If someone keys your car it's not something you have to shell out cash to fix. But, consider that if it breaks down or there is a serious issue with it for any reason that's for you to handle.\n\nB) Buying a car means that you can trade in or sell the car when you are done. I imagine at the end of your 24 months of school you have plans to get employed and get a new car to own. If you lease on a strict budget it is very difficult to build equity. This means when you go to buy a new car you are not likely to have any value left in your leased vehicle. On the other hand, if you buy then there seems to be a 300-500 range most dealers give for just about any vehicle and depending on how well you do with buying you can likely get a better ROI for when you trade it in.\n\nC) The future is your biggest variable here. 24 months is a long time for anything to happen and you need to consider that. What if you need to get out early? What are the options for both there? What if you need the car for longer than 24 months? What if your financial situation changes? All those fun anxiety riddled questions are very important to consider. \n\nAs a general rule that I apply to myself for many things I look at the end of my life. If I was on my death bed and crunched the numbers which option yields me the most long term cash? If I invest 10,000 total in a lease and get nothing back is it better to spend 11,000 total on a buy and have a trade in of 2 grand if I take care of it?\n\nHopefully, this all makes sense. The battle between lease and own is a pretty good one; I am confident you will make a sound investment and wish you the best of luck! if you ONLY need the car for 2 years MAX.... AND you KNOW you WON'T go over mileage... LEASE THAT PUPPY It depends on what car you want to lease. Leasing cost is essentially the calculated depreciation of a car plus interest and profit. This is why leasing a $30K Subaru costs way less than leasing a $30K Jeep. \n\nThe used car market is about to be flooded by tons of cars coming off of leases that were issued in record numbers over the past 3 years, which will put used car prices under pressure. Also, the immanent takeover of driverless cars will be a lot more obvious in 2 years, which will further depress prices of used cars. Thus, what I absolutely not do is buy a $15K car with the hope of selling it for $10K 2 years later. You may find that it is only worth $5K.\n\nIf it were me and I was going to school I would do one of 2 things:\n\nLease a cheap new or slightly nicer gently used car coming off a 2 or 3 year lease.\n\nBuy a very old car with a good reputation for reliability (i.e. Toyota or Honda) and hope you can get 2 years out of it before you junk it. This will also allow you to save on insurance since you won't have to carry collision or comprehensive on your own car. You've received many good answers to your question. I should reinforce that leasing or purchasing new is well out of your 30k budget. Purchasing used is your best route. There are many things involved when purchasing and owning a car. The vehicle price, taxes and fees to the state, registration, plates, and most importantly, insurance. Keep your budget below 3k for a car. But keep in mind you may pay between 1000-1500$ for all the other costs. Insurance will vary the most. It may be 500-800$ a year just for liability as a first time driver. When buying a used car you don't need full coverage just your states minimum. Since you're over 24 you're past the cut off on male drivers. Meaning your insurance will go down. Depending on your driving abilities, which provider you go with will matter. If you're good, go with a cheapie insurance to keep costs down. Liability covers you if another person causes an accident. But if you cause it, you're essentially fucked. Pay insurance in full so you're not paying monthly installment fees, typically an extra 10$ per payment. A person can generally pay in 6 or 12 month lengths. I recommend browsing Craigslist, carguru, or autotrader. I would also recommend you purchase a 4 cylinder vehicle like a ford focus car, ford ranger truck, Chevy Malibu car, Chevy s10 truck. 4 cylinders are great on fuel. Choose to get an automatic as manual cars are allot harder for first time drivers to figure out. Sedans or 4 door vehicles are much nicer when you have friends in your car. You should begin to figure out how much you can afford to put twords a car, fees and insurance in full before you begin searching for vehicles.

When parents do this it totally screws the kid over. 1) freeze your credit with all 3 reporting agencies.  This will stop future credit fraud.  While you're at it, get copies of all 3 credit reports.\n2) Contact each creditor.  Some are going to be quite easy to get rid of.  Since some are 17 years old and you're only 21, asking the question \"Are you in the habit of giving 4 year olds credit cards?\" will wipe out the debt.  Of course, cancel the card while you're on the call.\n3)  Get in touch with each credit agency for the same debts and ask THEM \"do you think card companies give 4 year olds credit cards?\".\n Some of the 60k is probably negotiable but either your parents face the legal consequences or you face the financial consequences.  Freeze your credit, and file a police report. They'll have to face the issues. Don't let them guilt you into not doing it, don't think you owe them anything just because they raised you. They took criminal activity against you knowing full well exactly what they were doing, and hid it from you while you were growing up.\n\n17 years of history on that account proves it. 60k?! I was trying to see the positive of this and at least your credit history has age to it, but that much debt is absurd. \n\nWould your parents help you clear that debt up?

I'm sorry :( report the cards as fraud. >  But to put it simply, I'm 21 years old and I apparently have had an account for 17 years.\n\nAre you the primary card holder, or did they add you as an authorised user to their cards? FIRST, contact credit card companies. Tell them of the fraud & offer to show proof of your age. They were wrong to issue credit to a minor. They should remove accounts and notify credit agencies ASAP.  What THEY did was also illegal. Second, create a letter stating your age (attach your birth certificate) and demanding immediate correction - have it notarized. Make several copies.  Send it to the credit card companies & agencies and any other entity seeking payment.  Next, tell collections companies they are trying to collect on fraudulent accounts.  You will report them for harassment to your state AG, then do it. Finally, deal with your parents how ever you see fit.  You don't have to \"throw them under the bus\" the credit issuers were criminal in their acts & it is up to them to conduct their own investigation - you are NOT obligated to do their jobs for them.  I'd file the update as an update post, to get better visibility. No one that posted here is aware of the update unless they manually come back to it. No, you can't get in trouble for fraud if you don't report them. However, you're trusting them to follow through on their deception. I'd want to see them take out a personal loan TODAY from their credit union to be finished with it, or mortgage their house. If the agencies find out you knew about it, then they won't discharge it as fraud, since you were in on the behavior at that point.\n\nAlso, your parents are BS'ing you. You don't saddle your kid with $60k in debt to build credit. You add them as an authorized user on an existing credit card. What they did was straight-up fraud to get additional lines of credit. I bet that their credit is leveraged to the hilt. Repost this as an update, with details, about how much debt it says that you have, and how your parents are living, what house they have, how they're driving, etc. Good on you for taking this seriously. My wife had the same thing happen, almost cost us getting our first mortgage.\n\nOne absolutely critical item: Document, document, DOCUMENT.\n\nAs you get this cleared up, keep documentation of every step, every interaction, and copies of your eventually clean credit reports. EVERYTHING.\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause we could have missed getting a mortgage on our next house 10 years after cleaning up the fraud and had to go through the whole process again if we didn't document. Some scumbag collection companies put the fraudulent debt back on her credit report in the meantime and even illegally redated it to look more recent. This was before the days of free credit report access.\n\nShe had the original cleanup documents, and our rapid, overwhelming pushback meant we didn't even delay closing.\n\nThese days i check Credit Karma regularly. Good luck... please keep us updated. I will say though... if you do file a police report, where will you live? Do you support yourself on your own currently? I'm not certain your parents will get in trouble if you just dispute the accounts for being opened when you were a minor Thing is, there is literally no excuse for this. You cannot excuse yourself for racking up 17 years of credit card debt and loading it onto your son. Report it as fraud man.  This happened to a very very close friend of mine when she was really young. I'm not sure how credit card companies allowed her mom to open credit cards using the information of an 11 year old, but needless to say her credit is ruined to this day. Was this 60k racked up years ago? Were there any payments made on accounts?  667 is actually pretty high considering that amount of debt.  I'm guessing at least some payments were made during the run up to this? My parents did this to me. I'm 17 and apparently already have awful credit. If Ill thoughts could kill I'd be an orphan. freeze your credit now and dispute on 3 credit reports as you cant sign contract under 18 I want you to be aware that 650+ credit isn't HORRIBLE and if you want to you can bring this to court (I know it's your parents) I'm just providing advice and options\n\nStart doing well or keep doing well in school and you may find a good paying job that can help with student loans and may have a connection with a bank to help refinance your car loan to help lower your monthly expenses. \n\nI am really sorry to hear about this and I hope this helps a little! Your parents already made thier choice.  They chose free money instead of you.\n\nYou are conflicted, yes, but understand they committed fraud against thier own flesh and blood.  Demand the money or turn them in NOW! 'My parents opened accounts in my name' should be a sticky in this sub. I see this 2x a week in my feed. Send a copy of your birth certificate to each credit card company that shows you having a card.

For the most part, I file using the standard deduction b/c I usually don't have enough itemized things to claim.\n\nThe biggest one would be my mortgage, but you are looking at around $5k in interests, which is way less than the standard $12.6k for filed jointly.

Should I have received a 1098-T for this amount?\n\n\nedit: question #2 Wife and I got married in the middle of 2016 and bought a condo right after. We each contribute to Roth IRA and and get interest income from high-yield savings and re-invest dividends in a mutual brokerage account.\n\nBefore the marriage and property ownership (paying mortgage interest) taxes were fairly simple, just entering a W-2 on our own, and some 1099 data.\n\nWould something like taxact/turbotax/etc be simple for us given our life events in 2016? We'd be in about the 28% bracket or whereabouts. My wife and I made about 136K in 2016.  Because my 401K options at work are terrible, I had planned on opening an IRA this month for 2016, but because I have a 401K I see that a traditional IRA isn't deductible.  \n\nShould I increase contributions to my 401K until I'm maxed out even if the investment options aren't that great?  (I've already maxed the employer match.)  Or should I open a Roth instead? I was using a few different sites last night doing my taxes to see what the differences could/would be between them. I noticed that when it came to Tuition Deductions, this is where they varied.\n\nA quick background. I took a graduate class in the Fall 2016 semester. My company has a tuition reimbursement up to $12K a year. This was my first class I ever took under my job so assume the starting reimbursement level was $0. I was just reimbursed for the full amount of the tuition on Jan 22, 2017 via my paycheck ($3717 for reimbursement).\n\n On my 1098-T, Box 2 is $3717, I am less than half time student, Box 9 (Graduate Student) is checked. Everything else is blank or unchecked.\n\nI noticed on TaxFreeUSA that there is a specific input for how Employer Education Assistance in which I put the amount I was reimbursed. This as you would expect negate the $2000 deduction. On TurboTax or TaxSlayer, there was no such question asking me about Employer Education Assistance.\n\nMy federal return jumps from $840 to $1350 if I apply the $2000 Tuition Deduction.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n1. Did I miss something with TurboTax/TaxSlayer or I am to assume they expect you to do the subtraction of true out of pocket costs vs reimbursements on your own?\n1. On future tax forms, should I always assume its just the out of pocket cost for tuition (Total Costs - Reimbursed Costs) when filling in Box 2 of the 1098-T section?\n1. Since I was reimbursed in Jan 2017, should I account for the reimbursed amount on my 2016 taxes?\n1. If I hit my max reimbursed limit of $12K, I know that everything over the $5500 threshold is now considered taxable wages; how would I input that onto my taxes in regards to the 1098-T section (I know the $5500+ amount is just included in your W-2 taxable income)?\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAny help on the situation is appreciated! Thanks! [deleted] Getting my back taxes done! A few questions:\n\n1. Do I fill in the line for late return, late payment, interest estimates on the 1040s or can I leave it blank?\n\n2. The additional child tax credit for 2016 stipulates that no late or missing SSNs for kids will be accepted past the deadline (no extensions). The previous years didn't have this requirement. Can I still get the credit for past years (assuming I qualify) or does the 2016 requirement disqualify me for all previous years? We will be getting our child an SSN soon.\n\n3. Same question concerning other credits, for example: rebate credit of 2008 or making pay work credit 2009-2010, etc: are they still available to me for those years as I fill them out today in 2017?\n\nMuch appreciation! [deleted] Tangentially tax related: I want to fill out my wife's IRA before the April deadline. If I want to open a spousal IRA via Vanguard, do I just make another IRA within my login account, or do we create a separate login account for her, make the IRA within that, and fill it with money from our joint account?  My husband and I purchased our first home in April 2016. We were not eligible for MCC (income) and I put our mortgage interest into the tax software (Credit Karma) and it came back that we're better off taking the standard (by ~$600). Are there no longer benefits for being a first time homebuyer? Were those just for 2008-2010 purchases? Is there a reason why Credit Karma Tax isn't allowing me to fill out the state tax return forms, let alone file them?  I know that NJ is \"delaying\" the disbursement of funds, but I don't understand why I cannot fill out my forms like I can with TurboTax.  I've always done my own taxes and understood how they worked, even though they were pretty basic.  Just itemizing deductions.\n\nThis year is more complicated.  I bought my first investment (single family rental) property in 2014.  It was a foreclosure and needed to be completely gutted and redone basically from the ground up. New roof, wiring, spray foam, sheetrock, the works.  I did it in phases as I had the money, so it wasn't done and ready to rent until July 2016. Am I correct in thinking the property's total basis is what I paid for it + settlement (not mortgage) costs minus the \"basis from land only\"? (land only from appraisal)\n\nFrom what I gather, since the property wasn't ready to rent until July 2016, I should start depreciating all of the improvements this year since that's when it was put into use?  Also, from what I can see the depreciation basically falls into 2 main categories for me- the big improvements like the roof, electrical, structure stuff etc would be over 27.5 years and the appliances over 5 years? Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Afraid I might have to hire it out this year. I'm using Credit Karma for my tax filings this year.  I finished my federal income earlier this evening, but when moving on to state filings, CK says \"Michigan isn't processing tax returns yet.\"  It's Jan 31st.  Unless my Google-Fu is failing me, I don't see where Michigan begins to process them.  Any ideas, or is this a CK error? Hi, first time for me filing taxes on my own with a W-2 (I was purely freelance before).\n\nSo now I'm in a situation where I have my W-2 from my full time employeer, and several 1099-MISC forms from the freelance jobs I did. I had two jobs where I made $60, and $150 from two clients. Obviously I don't have 1099-MISC forms since they are under $600 (or whatever the limit is). Using TaxACT (I think I'll use TaxACT anyway...), where do I add these small amounts? Thanks So the difference in refunds between itemizing and taking the standard deduction is $20. I should use the standard deduction shouldn't I. It's only $20 and I know if I itemize, my state refund will be reportable income next year. Year end bonus - for 2016, announced late January and hits in mid February - is it taxed as 2016 or 2017 income? Will matter for me in terms of eligibility for a 2017 Roth IRA.  My question is about filing a 1099 or W2. I'm a private nanny who has worked part time for the past year and more so since finishing college in early September. \n\nI've done some reading about whether or not it's proper to file a 1099 or W2 for this and I'm still not sure which is the right way to go. The family I work for wants to file a 1099. \n\nMy income from them is approximately $4500 for the year and last year I lived with my parents who will be claiming me as a dependent. \n\nThanks in advance for your help! \n Other folks with Vanguard: you haven't gotten your 1099, have you? It says late January but I'm still waiting. Just checking. Okay, so I didn't do my taxes last year.  My withholdings were messed up and I didn't have health care, so I ended up owing like $300, and I just never did it.  If I do my taxes via turbotax this year, do I have to do last year's at the same time?  Will it just automatically know how much I owe?  Would this be a situation where it's best to go to H&R block?  I am very bad at this kind of stuff but at the same time don't want to waste a couple hundred bucks if it's easy to do myself. I got a 1099-G for a tax refund in 2015 apparently for $30. I took the standard deduction last year for 2016. Do I have to amend my 2016 return to report this or can I just hang on to this form and call it a day? So this is year 3 - who wants to take a shot at figuring out how to answer this question. I'll provide some details, and some assumptions others have made. TLDR at the bottom but details are pretty important.\n\nFirst the background: \n\n* US citizen (NOT dual) at Canadian University as Graduate Science Student\n* Paid by Canadian government via Scholarship in Canadian Dollars (NOT fellowship) - Scholarship covers my COL and tuition as I do research (it's intended purpose for Science Grad students). Note none of it is separated to specific expenses such as tuition or to pay for my research as a fellowship is designated.\n* Paid tuition at Canadian University using said scholarship.\n* Voluntarily took a Teaching Assistant job, which pays grad students as well in Canada.\n* No other source of income besides scholarship and TA. Total income ~30,000 CAD\n* Must file Canada and US taxes \n* Canada does NOT tax scholarships like the US, but I do get a form to report it on Canadian taxes.\n* 2014 taxes: claimed physical presence (PPE) test \n* 2015 taxes: technically did not meet PPE test due to substantial travel to US + flying through to other countries for both conferences and fun. Same reason for bona fide residence. \n\nAlright so now the question that comes up every year by US students in Canada. Do US students have to report their scholarships on US taxes?\n\n1. Some say that because you report it on Canadian taxes you don't have to report it on US taxes anywhere.\n2. Because you report it on Canadian taxes but they don't tax scholarships you must report this on US taxes as 'foreign income' - then whether you meet PPE or Bona fide decides whether it's taxed.\n3. Sort of 2 but instead of reporting it as 'foreign income' you report it in the scholarship form on US taxes (using [Worksheet 1-1 p.6](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p970.pdf)) and claim tuition deduction as well under education expenses. \n4. Canadian-US tax treaty allows you to not report any of your Canadian income as students. HOWEVER, the treaty only mentions Canadian students in the US not US students in Canada (seriously wtf politicians specify this shit).\n\nThe other question that goes with this: TA income is taxed in Canada, is that still taxed in the US if you do not meet PPE or Bona fide residence (eg report it as 'foreign income' or no)?\n\nThis is even more complicated this year as I graduated graduate school and left Canada in the Fall and returned to the US for work. I still have to submit Canadian taxes for the year, but I 100% will not meet PPE at any point within a reasonable period, nor will I be considered bona fide resident.\n\nSome expat sites say student visas mean you're screwed when it comes to scholarships, some CPAs say it's all good, some say something else. I have no freaking clue - tax code outside US is bonkers.\n\nSo... anyone have insight? Is this worth a massive post on its own?\n\n**TLDR:** US Citizen on 100% Canadian government scholarship at Canadian School for GRADUATE studies (science). Scholarship does not specify where expenses must go - as for science scholarships are there to cover you while you work for the PI. So scholarship went to paying tuition and COL in Canada. Reported on tax forms in Canada, but scholarships aren't taxed in Canada. Are scholarships required to be reported as 'foreign income' on US taxes? Hi, I'm trying to file with Turbo Tax and I have a retirement situation that seems to be stumping it. \n\nIn 2016 I changed jobs. I had a 403(b) with about $13,000 in it managed by Fidelity from that job that I wanted to convert to a Roth IRA with Vanguard. I did a direct rollover from the Fidelity account to a new rollover (traditional) IRA account with Vanguard. I received a 1099-R for this rollover.\n\nThe money sat in the Vanguard traditional IRA for a few weeks and gained about 25\u00a2 in value (I think it was invested in a money market fund by default. Then I converted it to a Vanguard Roth IRA. I got a 1099-R for this conversion too.\n\nI entered both the 1099-Rs (then deleted them and re-entered them after double-checking because I was sure I must have made a mistake somewhere). Turbo Tax counts the money I rolled over twice (once for each 1099-R) and adds more than $26,000 to my total and adjusted gross income amounts. When I preview my 1040, the $13,000 shows up once on lines 11a and b (IRA distributions) and once on line 12b (Pensions and annuities). Line 17 for IRA deduction is blank.\n\nBecause of this, Turbo Tax thinks I owe the IRS over $6,000. Note that all of this money was paid directly from one financial institution to another, and I never withdrew any of it. I'm pretty sure I only owe taxes on this amount once, at my regular tax rate, and I withheld enough to pay all of the income tax I have due. Does anyone have any insight? This previous year my employer sponsored my schooling 100% which included texts/online materials and what not. The tuition was tax free, where as any other expenses were taxed accordingly. Whenever filling out my school form, should I place any school materials required in said box?  I don't understand this accounting: a CPA had listed on a 1040 of mine a refund from another state as *minus* the refund. Why? I would think to have added it in somewhere as additional income then deducted it as it is not taxable. Instead, the CPA allows that amount to be deducted from my income (which is really only W2s). Don't get it. \n\nExample\n\nWages (w2s): 50000\n\nOther income: OREGON REFUND -200\n\nTotal income: 49800 What is the purpose of the dark, filled-in circles/bubbles on past California 540 forms? 1098T - Illinois \n  \nMy wife attended a masters program in 2014 and into 2015.  We didnt receive a 1098T in retrospect, as I keep meticulous records, and I have none.  \n  \nSo now, yesterday, we receive a 2016 1098T from this school.  It indicates 10,710 has been billed (our previous total cost was 19k for the 30 credits).  \n\n  \nAnyone know why I received this phantom 1098T a few years after school?  \n  \nIts worth $2,000 in lifetime learning tax CREDIT. For upcoming year I will be on my parents HDHP family plan for 4 months and my own HDHP plan for 8 months. I met the qualifications to open my own HSA while on the family plan, not dependent, etc. \n\nSo does that mean my contribution limits are 4 months of family limit and 8 months of single? Also would it be possible to put all contributions through my payroll? Even if 4 months are not through my employers plan  I worked in both Virginia and New York in 2016.  On the first page in box 2 of my w2 it shows $30000 for federal wages. On the New York piece it also shows $30000 for state wages, and for Virginia it shows $3000 for state wages. Shouldn't the NY wages amount be $30000  - $3000 or $27000? I'm so confused and any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit: i moved from Virginia to New York back in February of 2016 I've already filed my taxes for 2016, my question is regarding this year:\n\nI will switch jobs on July 1st of 2017.

I filed for code E when I should have filed for code F.\n\nI ran through my return and now I owe $3k to the state. Does this make sense? I haven't been getting any state taxes out of my paycheck. I filed E, 0, 0 on the CT-W4.\n\nIs there anything I can do now that would maybe reduce that number? Or do I have to face the music this go around and work with my local tax office to get that changed to F?\n\nAny help is appreciated, thanks! My now wife did not realize she auto-enrolled in a health insurance plan for the year of 2016 through ACA. She was enrolled in school completely paid for in scholarships and had little to no income from a part time gig. Now that it is tax season she received a 1095 confirming she had health insurance for the entirety of 2016. Her deductible is $2,100. Meaning she (we) will end up having to pay a lot since she had little taxable income. Is there any way of avoiding to pay for that if she didn't use the insurance plan at all? \n\nI know it was irresponsible to do and pretty certain there is nothing I can do at this point. On my taxes, can I deduct the last month rent, security deposit, and realtor fee I paid in September to move (Paid first, last, security, fee upfront) as part of the 'Rent Paid'? \n\nI sort of assume no for the Security Deposit, but not sure about Last or Realtor Fee.  Form 1098T\n\nI am using credit karma to file and can't find a place in the form to write that my 1098-T is for graduate school. As far as I know graduate school isn't deductible for State (NYS) but it is for Federal. \n Quick question about federal tax credits. My fiance and I co-own our house. We will both file federal returns as single for 2016... In 2016 we got a brand new central AC system installed. We got the manufacturer's cert stating we are eligible for the $300 tax credit for an energy efficient unit. \n\nQuestion is: are we both allowed to claim this credit on our federal tax return being that we both file as single for 2016? We're not sure if this is a per household or per person deal. I've not found anything that says it is per household so I'm thinking we can both claim for that credit.  I lived in three seperate states in 2016. UT, MA, and MI. I only earned income from the state I was living in at the time. So this means I don't qualify for double tax credit right? \n\nI need to figure out my student loan interest deduction for each state. This is done by taking the total interest, say $2500, dividing it by 12 months, $208.33, and multiplying by however many months I was in the state for. So 3 months in UT is $625 student loan interest for that state. Or is there another way of figuring that out? Does the number have to be exact because for MA I was there a little over 6.5 months. \n\nNow I also got a 1099-INT from bonds I cashed out. This $400 interest income is claimed in only the state I was a resident at the time which would be MI correct? Not the state where the bank and bonds were located?\n\nOverall I'm earning about $140 less in taxes this year even though I made 3k more. Is it worth it to go somewhere to file taxes given some of the complications this year or should I stick with TurboTax? This is more of a theoretical question - Last year my wife and I forgot to change our withholding's for 2015 after we got married. In the end we owed around 4500$. We changed it for 2016, also purchased a home and had a second child.  In addition to this we made roughly 20K$ less through out the year. We didn't change tax brackets or anything but some how owe even MORE money than the previous year.  Does this make sense or am I doing something fundamentally wrong. My grandfather added me onto a stock account that has roughly $130,000 in it in December. He passed away last week and I am trying to figure out what I will owe in conjunction with that account. \n\nHe left half of it to my sister, and it will go into probate. Will I be on the hook for all the capital gains earning throughout 2016 or just what were earning after I was added in late December?  [deleted] I'm super confused about the withholding for my spouse and me.\n\nI make ~$41,000 plus have a part-time job where I make ~$5,000.  My spouse makes ~$39,000.  When I put just my info into turbotax (married filing jointly), it said I was getting a refund, but when I added in my spouse's info we now owe $2k.  I asked him to check on his withholding amount today, and he's at 0.  I'm at 1 for my main job and 0 at my part-time job.\n\nI get that we didn't pay enough taxes, *I'm just trying to figure out where the exact issue is*.  When I use the IRS withholding calculator, it says all jobs should be at 0 plus $125 extra between all our pay periods each month.  This seems so extreme. I am doing my fianc\u00e9's taxes and I think I have figured it out correctly but wanted to double check before I submitted. He is an electrician, worked at one company until November first. Switched to another company began November 2nd. The problem is company number two is based out of California, which apparently makes things more complicated, also we live in Texas. So what I did (turbotax) is entered both companies in for the federal and then entered just the CA company in for state taxes.. Is that right? Is there any further complications I need to consider? Thank you in advance! I am thinking about contributing to my ESPP this year, but I have always been afraid of getting hit with extra taxes / complications from participating. \n\nIs it typically worth it? I believe we get 15% discount with the lower of start or purchase date and can sell immediately.  Hi there! :) Married-filed jointly (husband had no income for 2016 because he just immigrated over), T-1098, and a HSA form. Nothing strange. I filed on 1/25 and accepted on 1/25 (via H&R Block).\nI checked the IRS site today and it stated \"We are still processing your return, please check back for a refund date.\"  \nIt seems there could be an issue or error? When I asked H&R Block's chat function, the gentleman said he hasnt heard that before..... This one should be easy:\n\nIf I rent a single room in the house that I own, do I have to manually split the interest in TurboTax? There's a place to allocate rental by days of the year, but not between percent of the house that's rented and percent used as a primary living space. Hi, hopefully someone here could help or offer some advice for my situation. \n\nI entered a loan rehabilitation program last year for my school loans, which unfortunately due to negligence, ended up becoming defaulted. So my previous return was offset to pay my loans. This year, the same thing happened. Now I read somewhere that if you're able to provide proof that you're in a program like this and are making satisfactory payments towards your loan, your return can be saved from being offset. Is there any truth to this or am I just out of luck? Thanks.  I have an HSA, and I was trying to file for free via TurboTax. They said I needed to pay an extra $30 or so to file through them because of this. Is there another site people use where they can enter that info without having to pay that much? Does my HSA even need to be anywhere on my taxes? Sorry I don't really know how it all works. This is my first year having one.  So I have a case where I am paying for my younger brothers college, but im pretty sure my parents are claiming him as a dependent. Is there anything I can deduct? If so where (giving the fact that I paid for his tuition, and he still lives with my parents) [deleted] 1098-T\n\nI paid my tuition in Jan 2016 (out of pocket) and I understand that since it's part of the 2015 Academic year the school will only issue me a 2015 1098-T. Am I still able to put that in my 2016 taxes since it was paid in 2016? [deleted] Should my fiance expect a 1099?\n\nHe was paid for participation in a clinical trial that ran 12/16-1/17. He received $425 in December and another $425 in January. He is below the mandatory reporting threshold for each calendar year, but above the threshold for the duration of the clinical trial. Obviously he will report the $425 on his return regardless, I'm just wondering if we should expect a 1099 or just file without it. Hi! 2016 was a year of changes for me, got married and bought a house, so I'm trying to make sure I'm filing all these new things correctly. We live in Florida.\n\nIs there anything special I need to know concerning the house purchase or my mortgage? I have friends vaguely referencing, \"oh since you bought a house this year, your return should be huge!\" \n\nLike, is there some other special paperwork I need to fill out or something I need to apply for to get a tax break concerning the house, or do I just put in the info from the 1098 and I'm good to go? Another one of my friends that bought a house last year said, \"Oh make sure you apply for such and such to get a tax break for the house\"\n\nSorry I'm so vague, I don't really understand all the specifics and I've just been hearing so many rumors from different people concerning what I need to do that I'm very confused.  [deleted] I wanted to check on this.  I sold two properties in 2016.  One our primary residence, and the second was an \"forced rental,\" dues to market/timing.  The \"rental\" I've been renting for the past 2.5 years, but I lived in it up until that point.  So as I understand if you live in a property for 2 of the last 5 years before selling it you don't have to claim capital gains. However, it also seems if you sell two properties under the same calendar year you have to claim capital gains on one of them.  Is this correct?  One sold for 260k and the \"rental\" for 117k.  So I am going to have to pay capital gains on the rental?  \n\nNote: I've been using Turbotax to do my work, and I wanted to make sure it's all correct.   My annual 401k contributions are capped due to being a high earner at my company, I generally stop contributing around the 12k mark. I really need the additional 5k as that is about my only option for lowering my tax bill. I itemize and have one dependent but that is it. Any other options for tax savings? [deleted] Last year I started work and made (very) roughly $34,000. I got back around $1,000 refund.\n\nThis year I made ~$72,000 and owed $1,000 to the IRS. I was expecting to make more back in a refund because of the refund I got back the previous year. \n\nMy question is why did I owe this year? Is it because my tax deductions from my paycheck are insufficient? If so, why was this different than last year when my tax deduction election has not changed? Is it because the \"standard\" deduction doesn't go as far when I make more money? \n [deleted] Last year i made $54,000k (total) between two separate companies  of this $7,500 was a bonus check. I went exempt on this. Before inputting the w2 info for the bonus check employeer I was calculated a refund of about $9k (i have 3 kids). Now its down to $1,250... Is this because of the exemption on the bonus or did I input something wrong? Please let me know if more info is needed. Thanks whoever responds. i moved from CA to OR on the 2nd january last year, and stopped working a full week and a half before my move. this year, it shows that i made 1200$ in California in 2016, but i really, really didnt. what could cause this to show up? Incorrectly claimed excess Roth IRA contribution from 2014 on 2015 taxes. Do I need to amend?\n\nHere's the situation: I made a Roth IRA contribution early in 2015, but then at the end of the year my income was higher than expected, making my contribution above the limit. Before filing my 2015 taxes, I withdrew the excess contribution (minus the small loss, as calculated by the investment manager). I was all set.\n\nHere's where I made a mistake: On my 2015 taxes, I accidentally claimed a 2014 excess contribution (form 5329 line 18), even though there was no excess for 2014. This didn't actually change my tax due for 2015 since I was subject to AMT. But it does mean I'll have to pay a penalty in 2016.\n\nIt seems like I have two options:\n\n1) Amend my 2015 taxes, in particular form 5329. Then file 2016.\n\n2) Pretend I didn't make a mistake. That is, don't amend and don't submit a form 5329 with my 2016 return, since I truly have no past excess contribution. Of course, my 2016 and 2015 returns will be inconsistent. I'm worried I'll get audited and this will be a bigger hassle.\n\nI called TurboTax, and their \"tax advisor\" recommended option 2. Do I amend or just ignore it?\n\nThanks for your advice. Hello. I am a foreign national (I believe my status is \"nonresident alien\" or NRA) and my husband is a US citizen.  This is our first time filing as married, and we're not sure how to approach this.\n\nHere is some information I believe is relevant:\n\n* We got married in 2016.\n* He lives and works in Texas.\n* He's paying off his student loans. \n* He just got back to school (2017).\n* I live and work abroad in my home country.\n* I have a SSN from my time in the US as a student.\n* I haven't lived or worked in the US in 2016; only visited.\n* Aside from my finances at home, I have a US bank account which I deposit money into occasionally, and a US credit card which I use sometimes.\n\nAs I understand it, we have the option to either file as \"Married Filing Separately\" or \"Married Filing Jointly\" (treating me as a \"resident for tax purposes\" through some paperwork). How do we know which choice is best for our situation? Thanks in advance. Quick, hopefully easy questions. Student here filing myself sleuth TaxAct. \n\n1. I worked 2 jobs this year (2016), one in my residing state (NJ) and one in another state (SC). I have W2s for both. I have completed filling my TaxAct out, but only see Federal and NJ return. Should I see an SC return or something? I only lived there for the few months I worked there, and did not become a resident, etc. just looking for clarification on how to file taxes when working in two states. \n\n2. I leased a car this year in my name. Are there any tax considerations with this? Since it's a lease, I don't pay sales tax. \n\nThanks! Questions regarding 1098-E, 1098-T, and who gets to file for what:\n\nI am not married and my mom claims me as a dependent. Both my mom and I took out government loans to help me pay for college.  Both her and I have made loan payments in 2016. We've both received our own 1908-E forms indicating how much interest we've paid on our separate loans. However, we have only received one 1098-T, which is the amount of money billed for tuition this past year.\n\nIn the past, my mom was the only one paying loans so she would automatically get the 1098-T.\n\n\n1. However, since we are both paying, who gets the 1098-T? I was just going to let her use the 1098-T to file her taxes since I'm her dependent and she's paid more overall than I have. However...\n2. Now that I have my own 1098-E, do I need the 1098-T form to compliment the 1098-E form while filing?\n3. ...meaning if she uses the 1098-T to file, can I file my 1098-E alone (I'm assuming no, but just want to confirm)?\n4. Or can the problem just be solved if we both use the 1098-T while filing  and file our own 1098-E forms (Assuming no, once again)?\n\n Both my college and my loan servicer says to ask our tax preparer but we don't have a tax preparer. Thank you in advance! (Edited for formatting) Got another 1098-T - received a \"scholarship\" from my employer for a class I took last year. Should I amend my taxes for this or am I risking an audit if I let it slide? Hello financial gurus of reddit. Could you help me understand some of these tax rules.\nI will not be filing federal income tax this year, so is it correct that next year I will be exempt from underpayment penalties? During this year can I submit a W-2 with 12 claimed allowances so that no federal taxes are withheld, then pay what tax liability I owe next year? During next year can I then pay three estimated tax payments quarterly, equaling 1/4 of 100% of this year\u2019s tax liability each time, then the remainder of my tax liability for the final quarter? Would that avoid all underpayment penalties? Would incur and interest charges in either of these years? I don\u2019t believe that I can submit the W-2 as exempt because I anticipate a tax liability for both years.  Should I claim myself as independent or dependent?\n\nMade around $20k tax year, full time student. Received government aid and scholarship.\n\nI guess the difference would be if my dad or I get the educational credits? IL resident that moved to MO in 2016 with a general question about my tax situation.\n\nIn 2016, I earned ~$4000 working in MO (STL) while living with parents in IL and ~$20,000 working in IL while renting in MO (STL) this year.\n\nSt. Louis has a 1% municipal tax for both employees and residents in addition to my state taxes for IL and MO.\n\nI also made over $3000 in student loan payments this year (all federal, no private). I do not have an IRA but I do have a 403(b) that I made payments into in 2016.\n\nGiven my situation, is it feasible for me to use low-end software or Free File to file my taxes or should I pony up for a CPA? [removed] [deleted] My wife and I filed jointly this year for the first time and when she entered in the amount for her student loan to receive a tax credit she put in the total amount of the loan she took out and paid up front to the school. Is that the proper way to qualify or was it supposed to be based on interest she may have paid? I'm not familiar with student loans and their effects on taxes and I'm kind of wondering if it was done wrong should I try to make an amendment. Sorry for the wall of text and improper formatting. Hello reddit. Obvious throwaway. I have two medical insurances: One that is freely given to me through the OHP Oregon Health Plan; another (my main) paid for out of pocket through a private insurance provider. I've had both plans for about the same amount of time. I've only used my main plan for any medical expense, saving the OHP as a secondary insurance.\n\nI've recently received a 1095-B from OHP but no 1095-A. My private provider is still mailing my forms.\n\nUsing TaxAct you are asked about \"government sponsored plans\" I checked yes for that due to OHP. Then it asks for a 1095-A, But I never received one. I contacted insurance companies and they have no idea, requesting that I ask \"tax people\".\n\nQuestions:\n\nWhat do I do about the 1095-A?\nDo I claim my main insurance as a medical expanse?\n\n\nIn advance, thank you very much for your help. please request any information that you need.\n\n\n I opened a Roth IRA this year, using Vanguard (because of this subreddit!). \n\nHow is this going to effect my tax refund when I end up filing? I was able to max the contributions for the year of 2016.\n\nWill I see a positive, negative, or zero effect? Hello. I get all my tax forms in January. If I contribute more to retirement accounts in February 2017, will the account broker update that information with IRS automatically and before the April 2017 deadline? Will they resend me the new forms for my record? Basically, how does that work?    Trying to file my taxes for 2016, I have a basic grasp of what I'm trying to figure out but some of the phrasing is confusing me. I'm 22, single, live at home with my mom (who has been unemployed for over a year), her SO, and my younger sister who's 17. I made $11k last year after starting my job in March 2016 (and was previously unemployed.) So I didn't have health insurance for all of 2016 and am now seeing a fine of about $700 which would be taken out of my returns.\n\nI'm trying to wrap my head around the exemptions.\n\n1. My mom did file for bankruptcy last year but I'm not sure if that qualifies *me* for that one\n\n2. I believe the lowest premium for a plan for me would be more than 8% of *my* income, but it says \"household income\" for the exemption (moms SO makes ~45k/yr I believe)\n\n3. There is an option for \"other hardships\" and I'm not sure if I could list my mom not working as an acceptable option.\n\nMy returns stand to be ~$985 without the penalties and I really need as much return as I can get, so any and all help is appreciated, just trying to figure all this stuff out.\n\nEDIT: Also I live in CT which is one of the states that expanded Medicaid (I believe) so I'm not eligible for that. If I have a job in another state, but am not sure how long I plan to stay at this job, is it legal for me to keep my official residency for the company &  by extension, tax forms, at my parents house? \n\nIf it makes a difference, I live in a different state from the office, though the office (and where the money is earned) is in the same state as my parents.  I fully expect I'll have to go to an accountant or something for full resolution, but I'll throw this out there in case I'm just misunderstanding something.\n\nSo, due to some finical trouble, I had to cash in my 401k last year.\n\nOn the 1099-R, the \"Gross Disbursement\" amount is 39,539.83. Where does this number come from? My 401(k) was only worth 13813.47 when I cashed it out, and I only received 9,394.92 of that (minus the 20% withholding or whatever).\n\nDisbursement sounds to me like the amount I received (less the 20%) and it's not even close.  [deleted] [deleted] Hey all, newcomer here.  I'm here to ask about the benefit of a Roth IRA - a question which I'm sure has been asked and answered many times before.  As such, I'll apologize in advance for the repetitiveness.\n\nSo my question is this: what does a Roth IRA have to offer me?  I am 27 years old and opened my Roth IRA on Vanguard in 2015, and during that year I contributed just about the max of $5500.  I haven't yet made any contributions for 2016, and before I do I figured I should ask here to see why/if I should.\n\nWhat does a Roth IRA offer me that I can't get from a standard brokerage account?  I'm sure I'm overlooking something here, because the way I see it, the Roth IRA is exactly the same as my brokerage account except for the fact that I can't withdraw the funds if I need help with a down payment on a house or something like this.  Any pointers? I have my 1098T now... box 1 is empty, box 2 includes fall 2016 and spring 2017 amounts and 742 in scholarship/grant which i got from fafsa. I paid for most of fall out of pocke until financial aid got fixed and then it was applied and i git a refund. How do i report all this on my taxes? Ive tried googling and read that i enter the 1098t as is but also that i can only deduct what i actually paid. And when it comes to what i actually paid do i enter the amount i wrote them checks for (1012 or something like that im not at home to look) or the amount i oaid minus what i got refunded? (about $550 after subtracting refund amount from what i paid iver the semester) Thanks for any help! Long-term girlfriend and I purchased a home late 2016. We are not filing jointly obviously. She makes more than I do. We are under the impression that only one of us can claim the home and we think it should be her since she makes more. Is there something we are missing? Also I haven't changed my address just yet (we moved in less than 2 months ago) so I think I still legally live with my parents. Thanks in advance.  My wife and I both withheld married w/ 0 exceptions in 2016 since we owed a bit in 2015. Just did some preliminary stuff in turbotax and we owe like $4,500. How is this possible? Why didn't it withhold nearly enough?\n\nWe were going to do some renovations but I guess that just went out the window. I have a large amount of my portfolio (about 20k or 35%, rest in SPY) invested in the tech company I work at due to vesting of RSUs and an ESPP I didn't cash out immediately on purchase. I have some of it coming up on mid term gains for taxes in May/June for some of it. Is it better to wait it out until I can get a slightly better tax rate or should I sell to reduce the amount of risk in my portfolio immediately? The current gain is about $1,400 so not a huge amount but taxed at an income rate of 36.5%  Several years ago I exercised some stock options for a private company I worked for.  I've since moved on.  Last year the company went under.  As I understand it, they no longer have any employees or an office.\n\nWhat kind of documentation do I need to show they went under in order to deduct my loss?  There isn't anybody still there to ask for paperwork.  They never went public or anything, but obviously did issue shares.\n\nedit: in case it matters, I owned well under 1%, so I highly doubt I'd be able to recover any assets or anything like that. [deleted] [deleted] [deleted] Business vs a Hobby\n\nI'm an actor that works full time at a fairly high paying STEM day job.  I do tend to make acting money on the side, but I didn't make any this year.  I don't think I've ever made a profit living in Los Angeles and i've been doing it for 7 years.  That said I've made decent money and been on several TV shows.\n\nMy tax person has been letting me claim all those acting expenses even though I haven't been profitable.  I found this on the IRS's website, but it doesn't give a clear definition on whether I can claim it as a business even though its not profitable.  Do I have to stop claiming acting expeses...classes, headshots....camera/sound/lighting equipment to submit auditions through my agents to casting..computers etc...Between that kind of stuff and miles driven to auditions...I have a lot of deductions every year.  \n\nHere's the link [https://www.irs.gov/uac/business-or-hobby-answer-has-implications-for-deductions](https://www.irs.gov/uac/business-or-hobby-answer-has-implications-for-deductions)\n\nTo further explain.  one year I may make 10k....the next I might make 3k.  The next nothing.  And then again 7k. Its unpredictable.  The thing is...due to the nature of the business...you're often an audition away from being profitible.  I'll audition for a series regular that could easily make me a 6 figure earner several times a year.  So is this a \"business\" or is it a \"hobby\"? Hey! So I'm a poor college student and am really confused and concerned about what to do for my taxes this year.\n\nBasically, one employer didn't withold and registered my taxes in my home state, and one employer (that I earned much more with) did withhold and has my home address as the state I'm going to college in.\n\nI'm technically a citizen of my college-state, because I voted here, but I'm planning on becoming a citizen of my state back home because I never actually meant to switch.\n\nWhat should I do? With my wife making very little this year we somehow are close to the earned income tax credit.  We are a little less than 2000 over the requirement with two children.  She made right around 16k and as her income was added our tax return dropped from around 8000 to a little less than 4000.   I understand that getting a huge return is not ideally the best thing whereas you are keeping more of your own money throughout the year.  My question, though, is if there are any other deductions,credits, changes to my retirement etc that we could do to possibly get our return a little higher?  I am in a union paying dues of 13 dollars a week if that makes any difference I'm not sure.  Any help would be great whether it means a higher return or not.   We do have some bills we would like to pay off and a higher return would obviously help that, but I also am just wanting more information as to how many people \"manipulate\" their taxes for more favorable outcomes.  Thanks again all! Thanks to those that answered my previous question in this thread, one more:\n\nWe bought the condo mid-year and the property tax was prorated, accounting for an expected increase.\n\nWe want to deduct the prorate amount. I believe I have to obtain the property tax bill for 2016 and prorate it for the day of the purchase or the day after and include that (somewhere in taxact) - am I missing anything? \n\nWhere would I get a copy of said tax bill? (Chicago) - wondering if it's included in the pile of paperwork from signing. I just attempted to file my taxes through H&R Block's free software, but ran into a problem.  My federal tax return came out as what I expected, but my state taxes says I owe them a significant amount.  Some background: I only had 1 job in 2016, working full time in FL (which does not collect income tax), but lived full time in IN (does collect income tax).  Looking at my W2, there was IN state income tax withheld.  The H&R Block software says I still owe an amount that is a little less than half of what they already withheld (if that makes sense).  I worked at this job for part of 2015 and did not have an issue when I filed taxes last year.  What could be the reason I still owe my state more taxes? Thank you for you help; I'm completely clueless.     [deleted] Is it worth it for me to go to an AARP volunteer site to have someone do my taxes for me? I don't know much about them, usually my wife does them but I am this year.\n\nHere's my situation:\n\n- 52k/year gross\n- 50k mortgage\n- Work from home full time (I don't commute to any company events, so not trying to recoup anything in that area)\n- Wife does not work, no children, neither of us in school\n- Neither of us has student loans\n\nI'm just wondering if pursuing the home office tax credit and/or trying to get a tax credit for my home internet bill is worth it over just using one of the online services mentioned here and not itemizing things.\n\nThanks! I started working at a startup last year and received an equity stake in the company (in addition to my salary). Does that equity affect my tax situation? It is the typical (?) four-year vesting period. I am an independent contractor and receive a 1099 from the company I do work for, but my state (Vermont) considers me an employee. Do I need to file as self-employed and pay self-employment tax because I receive a 1099? I believe I am still considered an independent contractor by the IRS even though Vermont considers me an employee. Also, how would I go about paying state taxes? Shouldn't they be withheld from my checks because my state considers me an employee?  [removed] My paps claims whether he claims me or not, I will be getting the same amount back. I haven't lived with him since 2012, its now 2017 and Im 24 years old. Should I be continuing to let him claim me as a dependant? Is he honest when he says it wont affect the outcome and I'll get the same amount? I tried googling but there was no answer So I prepared my boyfriend's taxes on turbo tax and he was receiving about 900 dollars back. When I got to the end they wanted to charge him for filing a 1099-r so I said fuck it and went to credit karma. Credit karma says he's getting over 1000 dollars back. Is this normal? Did I do something wrong? I went over it multiple times and couldn't find anything that was wrong but now I'm paranoid. I am wanting to do my Fianc\u00e9's taxes this year. \n\nShe is from Poland and made more than $4,050 last year (barely) as an Au Pair. \n\nAre there any deductions for someone in her position that aren't obvious?  \nShe is a student also so I plan to look into that if it applies.  I was just hoping not to have her bent over by the taxman too bad.  \n\nThank you all.  I recently filed my taxes using Credit Karma (for the free state filing) and when I was done I notice I was going to receive way more than I expected! I am a little skeptical about this and want to know if anyone has had this same problem and has any advice for me.\n\nHere are some of the important details:\n\n- My wife and I filed jointly.\n- I made about 20,000 of taxable income and she did not work in 2016.\n- We were both full time students, I graduated in May and she's still in college.\n- I paid about 2,000 in fed and state taxes combined but am looking at getting almost 1,000 more than I put in.\n- I did receive a 1098-t form from both of our schools and while mine had 0 on it hers had about 4,500 on it.\n- We do not have any dependents.\n\nShould I be worried? Did I do something wrong while filing? Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Thanks LineBreakBot! Received a 1099 from a previous employer? I signed a W4 when being hired.\n\nI was working part-time for a local business and filled out what I believe was a W4 (I believe that's the one you sign as an employee and not a contractor, where the employer is taking taxes out for you) at time of hire. Fast forward ~6mo to a disagreement where I was fired. At the end of December (~5mo after I was fired) I was asked to meet and asked to sign a W9, to which I told them I'd think about it and took the form home with me instead of signing. I spoke with the person who does my taxes and they told me that I shouldn't have to sign the W9 if I have no intention of returning to employment with said company as I filled out a W4 prior. I shredded the W9 and thought nothing of it (during the meeting I made no promise of going back to work for this person).\n\nThe other day, I received a 1099 in the mail and it was explained to me that I need to fill it out as the \"team\" (which I was not a part of) was transitioned. I was paid $745 according to this 1099 I was mailed. I'd have to go back and do math via my bank account to get the total I was paid as it was all via a checkbook instead of something like ADP.\n\n \nWtf is going on here and what liability do I have? My understanding is that I'm only liable for what taxes were not actually paid from what was taken out during each pay period. Say the employer only took $90/100, I'd owe the $10 to the gov't. I quit my job last year and used to get an electronic W-2 file. Is my previous employer required to send me a paper copy in the mail or are they able to just say \"Sorry, you have to retrieve your own\"? Are [these figures](https://www.irs.gov/uac/payment-options-available-for-those-who-can-t-pay-in-full) still correct for paying late? Gonna file timely and pay most of it, but I need like another month to really pay the whole thing off. Hello. I am filing my taxes through TurboTax and I've hit a snag with my 1098-T tax credits. I was enrolled as a full time college for at least one academic period in 2016, thus qualifying me for the AOTC tax credit. I was enrolled, during the same period, at a separate community college with a less than half time course load.\nI entered my first (full time) 1098-T and qualified for the AOTC tax credit; according to TurboTax my refund was $2,834. Once I entered my second 1098-T (less than half time) I no longer qualified for the AOTC credit and my refund was reduced to $1,834. TurboTax's reason for the disqualification is listed as \"Did not take at least half-time workload\".\n\n\nThis doesn't seem correct to me. I was enrolled as a full time student and yet the one class i took form another institution (aid for our of my own pocket, no scholarships) is not allowing me to claim the AOTC credit. Is this an error on TurboTax's end or is this correct.\n\n\nDid the one class I took at another institution just cost me my refund?\n\n\nAny help is appreciated, I don't know what to do at the moment. My employer made $600 in HSA contributions. I made the remaining contributions up to the max. Per my W2, it looks like the $600 is being included as income in box 1. Is this right?  I work from home at the convenience of my employer. They provide my equipment, and pay for my phone line. At the request of my employer, I went to the physical building 34 days this year to train temporary employees. Where do I put the miles? Can I submit an amended return for 2015 if the only change I make is to classify pell grants as income so I will get more money back?\n\nSome info about what I'm trying to do:\nhttps://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/Documents/Report-Pell-AOTC-Interaction-2014.pdf I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/tax/comments/5rclhc/handling_relocation_deductions/?ref=share&ref_source=link) this question over in /r/tax and wanted to cross-post it here for additional visibility.  I hope that's okay.  I wrote in my original post:\n\n>Hi all,\n\n>In 2016 I relocated for work and I have some questions as to how to handle the deduction described on Form 3903.\n\n>In order to assist in my relocation, my employer provided me with a lump sum \"miscellaneous allowance\" relocation package. This package consisted of a check made out to me for $5000 and $3116.86 for \"tax assistance\" that was sent to the IRS to cover Federal income taxes, my state income taxes, Medicare, and OASDI. The total amount of $8116.86 is a part of my W2 Box 1 amount.\n\n>Also on my W2 in Box 14 is the same $8116.86 with code RLG. Finally, I have NO box 12 code P amount, which as I understand it is typically for employer-reimbursed relocation expenses. To repeat, there is no code P in my W2 Box 12.\n\n>Lastly, I know my relocation expenses that I paid out of pocket. The amount is roughly ~$3500 (EDIT: actually $3216) and includes shipping household goods, airfare, and short term lodging.\n\n>Given all this, I can compute Lines 1, 2, and 3 on Form 3903. Am I correct in showing Line 4 as $0 because my relocation expenses are a part of W2 Box 1? If so, am I eligible to deduce the full amount of my relocation expenses from my income for year 2016?\n\n>Thanks for the help!\n\nCan someone help me out?  Thanks! :)\n I worked some odd jobs at the beginning of this year before finding full time, salaried employment this summer.  I made a little over $5000 from three different sources. I have received a w-9 from one source and probably will from the other. The third source is completely self-employed work, and I don't have a w-9 to give myself. I've kept records of everything and I want my taxes to be above board--is this simple enough I could do myself using TurboTax, or do I need to have help from a tax preparer? [deleted] I am in the US air force. Taxes are usually pretty simple for me. I go onto the MyPay website and access my w2 and file through turbo tax.  I was planning on doing that this year, but i received a second w2 in the mail from defense finance and accounting service (DFAS) It says i made about $230 and had ~57 federal income tax withheld. It also has the state of california in my state tax section, which is where i'm currently stationed, but my filing state is texas, which has no state taxes. Oddly, the state income box is blank. Tomorrow i'm going into the finance office on base, but I was wondering if anyone had any ideas what this might be from? Dad filed his taxes already, but forgot to add a deduction. How do we go about fixing it?  This is really late, I hope someone reads this because I am lost in this situation and haven't been able to find an answer online.\n\nLast year, because of bonuses at work, I made $45000, paid about $5800 in federal income tax, had student loan interest of about $1600, and an HSA contribution of $1800. The return I got back was about $1300.\n\nThis year, as I always do before filling out the forms, I went through the usual paperwork, but found that my return was a hell of a lot less. This year I made $36400, paid $3450 in fed taxes, with the student loan interest and HSA contribution being the same ($1600/$1800). But my estimate return is at most, $250. \n\nWhat year am I filing wrong? My return for 2014 was also somewhere above $1000, but I made less that year than I did this year. \n\nI tried to order my tax transcripts through the IRS online, but when I enter my information they say my account is locked because I entered the wrong info. Now I'm really lost, and worried I filed wrong somewhere, somehow, and I'm worried about filing my taxes if I'm doing something wrong with this return or did something wrong in the years previous. A couple of years ago my business partners and I sold the code and rights to a software application from our company (OldCo). Part of the sell was that I would be employed by the new company (NewCo) and that each year I would receive a percentage of the revenue from a specific product sold. My former business partners continued to own and run the rest of OldCo. The way the revenue payment works is that NewCo would pay OldCo.  OldCo would in return pay me. This year I received a payment from OldCo at the end of the year (mid-December). This is the only payment I received from them and they informed me there would not be any tax documents sent over.  How do I report this on my taxes? \n\nI'm assuming a 1099-MISC Box 3 - Other Income.  Currently, based on my income I'm being taxed at about 28% for the income from OldCo using 1099-MISC.  I've also wondered if I should just do a Schedule C for business income and write-off other expenses as well. I've considered a Schedule C to treat it as business income, but the complication is that I continue to support the product OldCo sold and get a salary from NewCo for doing so.  I'm not sure if I can tie any expenses to the money received from OldCo to make it worth a Schedule C.\n\nEDIT: clarified \"software application\" instead of the previously used term \"product\". Hi I got several Question.\n\nMy situation:\nI became a legal US resident  in August 2016, before August I worked in Germany and payed german taxes.\n\nIn September 2016 I started my Job in the US and just got my W2.\n\nI put my wifes and my W2 into turbo tax and everything works fine, but once I type in my foreign income (32,000$) and claim the **foreign income exclusion** my federal return drops by 2000$ and my effective tax rate jumps from 9.6% to 12.6%.\n\nFurthermore Turbo Tax says that I owe 960$ in Pennsylvania  State Income Tax. But I was not a resident of PA while I worked in Germany.\n\n* I thought I can deduct up to 100k of foreign income? \n* Should I claim the foreign tax credit? (Since I payed higher german income taxes)\n\nThanks, I accidently missed a $679 student loan deduction on ~$38.5k AGI on my 2014 tax return. It was an asinine mistake - the PDF of one of my 1098E forms had two pages, and I only entered the first one. I used TurboTax for my return, so I believe the software makes it pretty easy to file an amended return.  \n  \nMy questions are 1) do I need to do anything to \"prove\" the additional deduction? It's the same lender, just a second loan, so I feel like it would look a little sketchy - especially as I would be filing it almost three years later. Second, less importantly, is there any way to estimate what the refund would be? If it's gonna be $50 or less, not sure I'd bother with it. I've been using Quickbooks Online for my LLC. I pay myself a salary every month and pay all my Federal and State taxes every quarter as they become due. Do I still have to do some sort of comprehensive tax thingy by April 15th for last year's income? I made 13,063 dollars in 2016, am 29 and single. I paid 813.09 into taxes but owe 966 because of the Affordable care act. I live in GA which didn't expand medicaid, and I made less than 16,000. I've been told all year that I would be exempt from the penalty so I've been pretty content, but while filing online(haven't submitted) I'm discovering it's hard to get exempt and it's looking hopeless. I don't want to owe $15 because I couldn't afford healthcare on an underpaid houly wage... My employer does not offer coverage, and at the start of the year I applied for coverage in the marketplace, but chose not to enroll because I was unemployed at the time and they quoted me at $150 while being unemployed... I'm feeling hopeless at this point.. I will owe taxes this year since I didn't have enough withheld. I am trying to figure out if I will be charged an underpayment penalty based off the IRS rules: \n\n> Generally, most taxpayers will avoid this penalty if they either owe less than $1,000 in tax after subtracting their withholding and estimated tax payments, or if they paid at least 90% of the tax for the current year or 100% of the tax shown on the return for the prior year, whichever is smaller.\n\nThe word usage for this is very confusing to me. If someone could explain it more easily, I'd appreciate it. Has anyone had luck in finding an accountant filing taxes that focuses on remote employees? I've been trying to find one but haven't had any luck and I would like to get the maximum refund this year if I can. Hi, I made 16k over the year of 2016, but had fed witholding of around 4.4k (short internship with a large base salary). At the end, I was paid a bonus of 5k, with a fed witholding of around 2.1k. I was wondering how the bonus would affect my tax refunds, and what the estimates of my returns would be? \n\nI understand that bonuses are withheld at different rates, but do we still consider them as one gross income, from which one flat tax rate is applied across? \n\nThank you!! I made ~12k over 2016 in the State of washington where I am a student. However, I'm originally from California and have not changed residence. I'm unsure of if I need to file California taxes or Washington taxes? Using TurboTax to file my taxes. I was a student at two colleges throughout 2016 but I am unsure if I qualify as a full or part time. TurboTax says \"full-time means being at a school for at least five months during 2016.\"\n\nCOLLEGE 1:\n\nSummer 2016 - 2 classes, 6 credit hours\n\nFall 2016 - 2 classes, 6 credit hours\n\nCOLLEGE 2:\n\nFall 2016 - 2 classes, 5 credit hours\n\nFull-time at both colleges is considered 12 or more credit hours.\n\nI assume college 2 is out of the picture, in terms of being full-time.\n\nWould I still qualify for full-time when filing 2016 taxes because I took a total of 12 credit hours at college 1?\n\nOr is full-time considered 12 credit hours or more EACH semester, i.e. Fall 2016, Summer 2016?\n I realized that I could deduct mileage to my monthly national guard drill on top of my standard deduction. This is quite a substantial amount. (6840*$.54/mile). Can I still take advantage of this deduction for 2015 and 2014 taxes? I believe I used turbotax for 2015 and tax act for 2014.

However, with the new loan, a ton of other options materialized, including the ability to make lump sum and re-occurring extra-principal payments. Turns out they are literally limited in what they can offer by what the loan holder dictates.\n\nI've found that dealing with CENLAR with the new loan has been absolutely fantastic.  It all depends on what your expected property tax and insurance payments will be next year compared to the current balance plus future escrow payments. They're required to do an escrow analysis once a year (not necessarily at year's end) and refund you any overages then. Generally they can in anticipation of the following year's disbursements, and as long as they pay interest on the escrow balance. My personal experience, I bought my home in late 2015, had a escrow balance going into 2016 (not $8k, it was under $1k) that they held. They also raised my escrow payments for 2016. I tried to tell them that their estimates were nuts but they didn't care (they estimated my property taxes for 2016 to be $1,200, they ended up being just under $500). A few weeks ago I got a refund check for $1,100 and they've adjusted the escrow back down to where it started. All that to say, it might take them some time to properly estimate taxes and/or insurance. I think my company has it correct now but they clearly didn't understand how low property taxes are where I live.  That is a LOT of money to hold for next year. I've gotten a disbursement from cenlar when i only had about 1500 sitting in escrow after taxes were paid. That $800 seems crazy high.  I pay $500/month for taxes and insurance on my $400k house.  I realize things vary wildly from state to state, but I thought everything related to housing in Texas was cheap. A mortgage company can hold up to an entire year's worth of estimated tax and insurance payments + an additional 1/6th of that balance.

Also, I hear nothing but praise for USAA from friends in the military and future generations of your family will be eligible for USAA thanks to your service and membership.\n\nIf the new USAA Limitless card is available in your area it offers excellent benefits including 2.5% cash back on all purchases with no annual fee. There is a way to get the card even if you're not currently living in an area that is open for applications. See this thread for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/comments/55p64q/new_usaa_limitless_cash_back_rewards_visa_25_cash/ I appreciate everyone's advice means a lot. I bank with USAA and will call them regarding their credit card after work today \n Usaa or navyfederal and use it for gas, uniforms and haircuts. Write off a job expenses and pay it off each month. USAA is the best way to go. I have my auto, renter's and life insurance with them. Usaa has a new card with 2.5% cash back. Imo that is far more important than a lower interest rate. Never ever carry a balance.  Do you want or need a credit card? She is correct. It is worthwhile to have a credit card. I recommend the Discover IT. You might have to get a secured credit card.\n\nNow, onto the BIG warning: It will build your credit if you use it correctly. It will destroy your life if you use it to live above your means. Start SMALL. Only put things that you would put on it anyway, like if you're filling up gas, or buying groceries. Pay it off IN FULL every month, so that you aren't paying interest. Start by setting a monthly limit of $50. See how you handle it.\n\nNow, onto \"just in case.\" You don't finance emergencies. That is just trapping yourself. You need to cut spending, and have a reasonable savings account at USAA that can cover these \"just in case\" situations. Need dental work? Pay from your emergency fund, not on a credit card. By putting emergencies on a credit card, you end up paying interest unnecessarily. Don't use your credit card unless you have the money sitting in a bank account that could FULLY pay it off tomorrow. Not necessarily a bad idea, unless you think you are prone to credit card debt.\n\nJust set it up to auto pay if full each month, change a reoccuring bill you have to use it, then just keep an eye on it to make sure the card is being charged and paid off.\n\nIts an easy way to build credit. Get your USAA membership now and their Visa or Amex are great. Make sure to pay it off each month. You'll make $400-600/yr in rewards and there's no fee. As an additional question, I'm a new credit card holder (21 m) and I find that I really dislike the layout of the information for my card, as in most of it isn't displayed online, or the website is a mess and mostly useless, I use simple banking and really enjoy the layout and the way that the information is displayed, can anyone recommend a card that has a similarly useful app?\n*EDIT* I like the ability to visualize my finances. while there are many benefits to credit cards, if you're not comfortable with having one, don't get one. it is possible to live without it\n\na credit card should just be an intermediary in the whole purchase equation. any purchase you make you should have been able to pay with cash\n\ni would suggest you establish yourself first, get used to paying bills and the like. being that you're 23, you may have already done this Contact USAA\n\nSource: was an underwriter for USAA. \n\n Get the USAA card, is amazing, can confirm If you don't want/need one, don't get one.  \nBut, if your mom is pushing you because she wants the deals and benefits that come with you having a CC and in active duty, direct her to USAA - I am non US and non military, so can't help you much, but it seems they have some good deals in regards to cashback.  \nedit:  \nUSAA seems to be open for registration to family members also, so probably you don't even have to register..

As long as you have self control with purchases, a credit card is a good idea to establish credit.\n\nGo to whatever bank you have an account with and tell the clerk you're interested in a credit card and they will set you up with a rep who will explain the options and you pick what works best for you. Be sure to listen closely and ask questions if there's anything you don't understand. They'll usually try to get you to sign up for certain insurances or benefits that come with fees. If you don't need or want them, ask to opt out. There are some decent ones with no annual fee; I have a Discover it which I like very much (good rewards, really easy to talk to a person if you call in with questions). Also the American Express Blue Cash Everyday. Like others have said, there's really no downside to using one if you are responsible. You can get basically 1-2% off all of your purchases and enjoy $0 fraud liability. Plus it helps you build your credit! Don't get a credit card. The FICO system will make you a slave. Just save up money. Money is the best credit  Insist on a low limit and never spend more than half of the available limit. \n\nThe higher the limit, the harder it will be to recover from if you max it out.  If you owe more than half of the available credit, it will impact your credit score, so I am told by a banker.  I would say don't worry about the APR because you should not carry a balance. If you can do that, then look for a card with a nice bonus sign up and no foreign transaction fees if you might be outside the US. I'm a NavyFederal guy, just out of loyalty, but PenFed's Defender cashback card is actually the best active duty military card I've found.

Here's advice: stop letting other people push you into doing something.  TBH I would avoid getting one at all until YOU decide. But the Platinum Secured MasterCard is good for building credit.

As this just just confirmed that she did not learn her lesson the first time around. \n\nI asked how much she owed and there was silence. She only revealed $30,000 in medical bills and some 'other' items. What really makes me mad is that she is hiding the truth from me. I know this, as I have been lied to numerous times in the past. On top of that, she tried her guilt tactics to try to get me to feel bad for her.\n\nI used to fall for that stuff, but not anymore. I'm really upset at her.

If she's been through it before, she knows the process well enough to fill out the forms herself.  Offering to review her paperwork and research some online advice will be much more helpful than giving her money at this point.\n\nDon't be angry about it.  She doesn't owe you money.  She's embarrassed and in a tough situation.  The fact is, most people who go through BK once end up in that same boat again.  Getting back on your feet and sustaining it is extraordinarily difficult once you lose everything.\n\nThere is absolutely no sense in giving a relative who's about to go through BK any money.  It only prolongs the inevitable and leads to future hostile relations.  Helping them financially a *little* once things settle is the way to go if you are so inclined, but no loans.  The only reason to do so pre-BK is if there are kids involved and that's not the case here.\n\nIf she's trying to be private about her finances, just be plain.  You can't help without information.  Just like the judge can't help.  Just like the lawyer can't help.  She can't afford a lawyer, so she's going to have to come clean to someone.  Whether it's $200 or $1600 or $16000, giving money to someone pre-bk is plain and simply a bad idea.  The debts will get cleared whether she spends the money or not, so there's no logical reason for her to _require_ a professional.  She can file all on her own with the filing fee, and stop all collection and payments right away.  She can then amend her filing or cancel her filing if she hasn't gotten it right and start back up again.  If she shows up in court with paperwork that isn't right or if the judge thinks it's incomplete, he'll say so right away and give direction on what to do.  \n\nA lawyer is nice because he/she should make sure things are complete, handled timely, and ensure that the case is presented in the best light.  But it's really a nicety and not a necessity.  Maybe if there's backtaxes, student loans, or something that's difficult to navigate I'd see it as a necessity.  But medical bills and \"other\"...  just unplug the phone, fill out the paperwork, and start demanding that everyone communicate in writing via the mail. Demand full financial disclosure before agreeing to anything.  See if she's honest and willing to make a change. Then decide what you want to do once you've seen everything so you know exactly what is happening and don't give her anyting.  YOu can hire a lawyer for her.  You don't have to hand her money to help her.  Ask where the money is supposed to go and give it to that person if need be. Talk it over with your wife. Decide what to do.\n\nIf you decide to help, you might want to go with her to the lawyer and eventually pay the lawyer directly. We just went through this exact thing with my sister!  She declared bankruptcy like 20 years ago and never changed her habits, never saved, spent everything she made, never had a second job, etc.  She had a kid with a married dude and got sued for custody a few times, yada, yada, yada.  Basically huge lawyer bills, huge credit card balances, can't make rent, etc.\n\nShe tried to give us the guilt trip, the long winded email with self-deprecating loathing of woe-is-me crap.  Now, unfortunately we make a very good living, so giving her the $1200 she asked for would not hurt us at all.  Like this would be a bad night in Vegas kind of thing.  \n\nWe had to say no.  Plain and simple.  We gave all the reasons I mentioned above and that asking friends, family, and a bankruptcy judge to bail you out is not right, especially given the 20 year history of living a horrible financial life.  \n\nWe still talk to her and she's is surprisingly civil about family gatherings.  I think she just needed the tough love kick-in-the-ass advice in return.    I'm sorry to hear this. I don't think you can change her (it's hard to change another person). So this is her behavior, and it is likely that that behavior won't change. \n\nSo I guess what I would do is think as rationally as is possible about whether you want to support her (at all). And if so, how. You state that you want to give $800. If you feel that that is the right thing to do for you, and if you feel that you can donate the $800 and keep your own finances secure, then do it. And try to do it without feeling too much anger.\n\nI'm really sorry for you that your mother is like this. \n\nThis is out of the scope of this particular subreddit, but: You might want to consider consulting with a psychologist about how to handle your mother.  How to let her behavior affect you less (emotionally), and perhaps what to say to her, or how to act, so that she won't try guilt tactics anymore in the future.  Help her have a garage sale of her items to raise the money. Give her some of your time instead of cash. If you give her money, it would just be throwing it into a hole that you could never fill up. You could give her $20,000 a month and she'd still be stuck where she is. I would not help her. Tell her that you don't have it, but that you are 100% committed to helping her, so you will come over, help her see how to cut spending, help her sell various items on Craigslist, and get her finances under control. She gets 3 free credit reports per year. Also, Credit Karma and Quizzle are great free ways to check what's on your credit report. Help her with love and support, not by throwing money into that bottomless well. Obviously, she's doing something wrong, or she wouldn't be in this situation again.\n\nKeep your money for your own family. You have your own things to worry about. If you come post her financial details, all debts with balance, interest rate, and monthly payment, as well as all equity, we can help you help her, better than she would ever dream. I would really start by cutting spending, and downsizing her life. Sell her home for a smaller one, stop driving whatever car she is for something older and more reasonable/economical. Sell off the expensive paintings and furniture on Craigslist to get cash for an attorney. If she doesn't take the effort herself, she will never learn. Don't give her a cent, or the bailout will just keep postponing the inevitable. If you are willing to help out financially (and that's a big if), you should pay the obligations you agree to help with directly. If you're paying towards the lawyer, ask for a bill and pay it directly. Or whatever you agree to help with. If she's not okay with that, then there's more to the story that you're not getting. Ultimately, the guilt is coming from you, not from her. I think you need to sort out what *you* think your duties/obligations towards your mother are, and be square with yourself. Then she will not have the power to guilt you.\n\nBarring exceptional circumstances, I don't think you need to feel obliged to help here. \n\nIf you did want to help, I'd make it conditional on her giving you power of attorney over her finances and freezing all her credit accounts, or whatever else you think would be wise. The thing is, all that is a lot of work, to manage the money of another adult, probably in the face of her resistance, and it's totally reasonable to not want to take that on. \n\nIt's possible that just framing the offer that way will send her running in the opposite direction anyway, which might leave everybody satisfied, if not happy. Don't be an enabler.\n\nMy brother makes 4 times what I make and recently asked for $3,500 to pay back a loan, so he could take out an even bigger loan against his 401K.\n\nMinutes before he showed me a pork loin with raspberry chipolte sauce he cooked for 12 friends down at the local bar he frequents 4 to 5 nights a week.\n\nNo.  Hell no.   Even if you give her the money, are you also prepared for her to call you for the 3rd bankruptcy? \n\nIt is hard not to feel like you have to help  your mom. But doing so will only enable your mom's bad financial decisions. As others have said, I would not recommend giving her any money/ cash, if you are concerned for her wellbeing and unsure if she has enough money to feed herself etc maybe get her a giftcard for her local grocery store? As long as she's warm and fed, it's not the end of the world, but dont throw money down the drain. Ok, one more thing to educate yourself about. You mom may be judgment proof; that is, depending on your state, if all of her assets are under the exemption limits for your state, and also that all of her income is from exempt sources, such as SS and retirement income, she would have the choice not to file bankruptcy, but simply not pay the bills.\n\nYou would want to consult a bankruptcy attorney first, and be ultra sure that she is judgment proof. What will/could happen is that her creditors will bug her incessantly; she needs to write to each, saying \"I would love to pay my bills, but I can't, I don't have the income, don't contact me.\" Under the terms of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, they are not allowed to contact her after that letter.  Or, if she has an attorney, she can inform them to contact her attorney and, likewise, they are not allowed to bug her anymore.\n\nThen, they can sue her and get judgments against her, but she doesn't have anything which could be garnished. (Again, you need to be quite certain about the character of her income and assets.)\n\nAny secured loan, such as a house or car, of course, she needs to be able to pay, or she will lose it. She should stop paying unsecured loans such as medical debt and credit cards, if this is the route she chooses.\n\nAnd, her credit will be nonexistent forevermore.\n\nJust an additional choice; good luck. \n\n Yes that is really hard. Difficult as it is, try not to take it too personally.

This doesn't necessarily make them bad parents, but it definitely makes them doing something that bad parents do.\n\nBy the way, it is not \"legal\" for them to spend your inheritance (even if you were a minor) unless you signed it over to them.

It's just harder and harder the further east and into affordable housing areas you get.\n\nI would avoid dipping into retirement funds at all costs.  Lean on family.  Live frugally.  \n\nIf you absolutely need a car, look into uber/lyft short term rental/lease programs.  The way it works is that you get a car to drive around in and you commit to ~75 rides a week.  Which is a LOT of hours, but it's also income that you are earning right out of the gate, a job that you can turn on and off at will when you have interviews to go to for a better job, and transportation to those interviews.  Save everything because you're going to give that car right back the day you get another job.  The costs are only worth it IF you have no car and you have no other income solution.  It's actually a decent way to network with people when you are job hunting. Your girlfriend is American right?\n\nBasically apply to everything you can and then quit when you get something better.

I work in IT, and from what I see, the first level helpdesk people are generally offered opportunities to advance to other positions, like Telecom, or networking, within a few years.  My friend started working at a large hospital/clinic corp this year at first level helpdesk, and will be moving to on-site, hands-on support in a few months. Get a job before moving  Sorry but anywhere within 80 miles of san fran is stupidly expensive to live and wouldnt recommend anyone live within that radius until they are financially well-off. I'd look at public transport as your number one method of getting around. I live in the south bay and for work I take my bicycle to the caltrain and then ride it to the office, no need for a car. \n\nRent is going to be insane, for a 1 bedroom expect 2k - 3k depending on the area and how new the apartment is.

Read books on therapy. Put up with the cosmetic damage; shrug it off. Know what you have with that damage? A $6,000 car. Know what it will be worth if you repair it? It will still be a $6,000 car.

And even then, the tax savings, once you account for the fees, was going to be minimal.  Those things are best for really rich people who are fazed out of most tax benefits....I think, not even sure if it makes sense for them either.   You can \"replicate\" all the aspects of whole life insurance in a manner that is cheaper and easier to understand.  Specifically, get yourself term life insurance.  You size that policy based on what you believe survivors will need. At a minimum, you want to have enough to pay down all debt and get people back on their feet.\n\nYou can also open an IRA or 401k.

Term makes sense for the majority of people if the purpose of the insurance (which I strongly feel it should be) is to replace your income for your family if you die unexpectedly so they aren't in immediate financial hardships.\n\nThere are hybrid term/whole products in the US that bridge the benefits of both. It would be worth hearing from another broker about those if some of the whole life stuff seemed to make sense to you. Whole life insurance does have a place and a purpose - but only once all other savings vehicles have been maxed out.

I'm honestly lost and these last few days have been such a blur that I just need some guidance.\n\nAnything to point me in the right direction is appreciated.

Need to know how to take care of my Mom.", "comments": "She should qualify for survivors benefits from the social security administration.  Talk to them.  They tend to be very helpful about setting up benefits. It looks like Dad was very responsible and left your Mom well off. Good on him, and you for stepping up. Believe me, there are a lot of kids who would just flake out. Just want to give you and your dad props for being good folk. On a 'non finance' angle, try a group like a Widowed And Young (WAY) or Way Up. My mum went to them after my dad died and they provide loads of emotional support. It's people of a similar age to your mum who have been through the same thing.\n\nThere are similar groups for children who have lost parents as well.  Don't touch the 401k or pension yet. Everyone has hit on some good notes, but I'm replying to give some order here. \n\nMake the arrangements, call the funeral home, and don't be afraid to ask around, especially for cremation. We saved 1,300 dollars by calling someone 20 minutes away. \n\nTake inventory, do you have liquid assets? Cash or gold? You'll need some money before the insurance money arrives. Once you know how much is available, start figuring out what needs to be handled and how quickly you'll need it. Call the life insurance, call the bank if he had a separate account for himself, look for investment accounts. \n\nHire a tax preparer and file an extension, 75 days probably won't be enough time to gather and do all that needs to be handled on his behalf. Also, start rounding up any outstanding bills. Mortgage, hospital, ect. \n\nWas your mom listed on all accounts? You could very well need multiple copies of the death certificate. \n\nNow, the financials, this is the easy part. Dont listen to anyone who isn't licensed or works in this particular field. Which I guess includes me. But I was in your shoes and the money was similar. You've got to find a way to get her insurance. If the money works, pay for COBRA for a few months. Nothing will eat her cash quicker than medical bills, so get COBRA for now. Part of the ACA, like it or not, was expanded Medicaid, your mom very well could qualify, and she might be able to get a plan through the market place (obviously this isn't a long term plan with the repeal pending) but we are bridging the gap between today and your mom getting on Medicare as a disabled woman. Which will be your only option, and takes some time, we just got to bridge the gap. \n\nThen, you find a financial advisor. And I'm sure there are very qualified ones near you. My dad was the smartest investor I've ever met, and he was adament about using Fisher Investments. Do your research, don't just take anyone at their word, ask around. Get the money into good hands, the good news is you're actually in an amazing position, you just have to handle a few things first. I'm sorry for your loss.  Dad's insurance may offer cobra coverage to mom for awhile. So sorry for your loss. Your moms insurance should be fine as you sort this out.  Eventually if mom is disabled she can qualify for maybe medicare or she can pay the monthly medical insurance with her life insurance proceeds. There are grace periods for insurance by law, you have at least a month to figure this out. Also ask for a bunch of copies of your dads death certificate from the funeral provider.  Look into her health insurance as top priority. Can she be covered by cobra? If not, she needs to get a healthcare.govplan within 60 days of her last date of coverage. Other than filing a claim with the life insurance company. Don't do anything right now. \n\nPlan the funeral and grieve.\n\nWorry about the money later.\n\nSorry for your loss.  Hey friend, sorry for your loss. I know it's very hard for you right now and your chest hurts from all the grief, but you need to stay strong for your mom. You're having to go through the hardest lesson life can give right now. I can't offer you much in the way of financial advice but I can tell you that the people around you love you and will help get you through this My condolences.\n\nThis link helped us a lot when my wife's father died suddenly. \n\nhttp://www.consumerreports.org/cro/magazine/2012/10/what-to-do-when-a-loved-one-dies/index.htm\n\nSome of the other things I did was find any appointments he had made and canceled them. We made a list of his friends and called them all personally so they did not have to find out through the grapevine. Mainly, getting the death certificate will be the key to enabling all the affairs to be dealt with. Don't forget DMV as identity thieves will target the dearly departed sometimes. \n\nAlso, I made a list of people who sent food, sent cards, came by to help, and those who expressed condolences. Once we got most of the paperwork done, we have been thanking those from the list.\n\nKeep track of your personal expenses dealing with this. If you need to, you can share it with any other beneficiaries in your family to make sure you get repaid. If your mom is disabled from the lupus, she should apply for social security disability. If she is approved, then she will have Medicare coverage, I believe. With the rest of the money, you could maybe pay off the mortgage (if there is one) and put the rest in an annuity that pays her a monthly stipend.  Very sorry for your loss.  Your local hospice probably provides grief counseling. I highly suggest you reach out to them to see what they offer. You and your mom may benefit from speaking to someone about your grief. Beyond that, your mom needs to meet with what's called an elder law attorney. You can go to the National Academy of elder law attorneys online and find one in your area. They specialize in understanding public benefits and retirement and affording life after death of a loved one, etc. I wish you and your mom peace and comfort. Consider getting Power of Attorney over her finances, so that you can deal with them as needed.\n\nMy mom\u2019s 82 and dealing with less and less of her bills--except spending way too much on bingo when she has $40K of debt.  And she blew through $150K of inheritance, on bingo, in 4 years.  Yes, that\u2019s a lot of bingo.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to make her listen to me about it.  I\u2019m getting PoA this weekend.  I already have online access to almost every one of her creditors.  If she has to sell the house she rents out (her income), I will be speaking to her financial advisor about an annuity or whatever to provide her with money, but I will take away her credit cards (leave her one and get that limited) and get a limit set on cash out of the bank per month.\n\n She may or may not qualify for disability, but she should apply for it just in case. It'll take forever for her to get approved if she is approved and the difficulty will vary from state to state. She'll likely be refused the first time no matter how appropriate a candidate she is because first refusal is almost universal. She should also apply for medicaid. See if you can contact a social worker at the country office and set up an appointment for your mother and go with her and get some help navigating the social services aspect. That's what they are there for - to help people work out what they qualify for and to have their needs met. Contact a lawyer. There are a lot of legal stuff that needs to be handled. I've been there. It is worth the money.  My dad passed away at 56 in December.  I get about 20k total.  The situation sucks, but you guys will be fine with over 1 million. [deleted] Honestly, just deal with the loss first. Once you're ready, I'd recommend learning about proper investment strategy. \n\nIf you are careful, safe and diligent, you can get a steady 6-8% return on investment. With all of your father's savings, this will be about 68,000-90,000 per year. This will be possibly enough to live on, but if not you can also work to supplement this income. If times are tough, you can dip into the initial capital (the $1,130,000). Maybe you'll need to use some of the capital initially for immediate expenses (funeral etc.).\n\nIf you want any advice on investing, contact me or something and I'll give you a few places to start off. Sorry for your loss, and don't worry about the finances, you have a strong situation from what I know. Dude, Times like this are 1 foot in front of the other for you right now.  Best advice, do the Grieving process, arrange your mothers finances and most importantly be certain to take some time off. Some thing that helps is celebrating your dad's life with family members. Sorry for your loss.  It's hard, but it will get easier.  I'm coming up on the 1 year anniversary of my Dad's passing.  You'll come out the other side on this.  \n\nGood on your for taking care of your Mom.  Echoing others who say to contact SSI.  I would also add that you should talk to a financial advisor as well as a lawyer to make sure her own estate affairs are in order.  Make sure that your Mom has her paperwork in order as far as a will or a Trust, power of attorney, advanced health care directive, etc.  Not necessarily now, but you should make this a priority for the future.  God forbid something happens to her and she needs someone to make decisions on her behalf. \n\nHang in there.   I would see if its a good idea to invest most of that money so that it can earn interest to add to the bucket...good luck, sincerest condolences during this difficult time...mucho love to you and your mum Sorry for your loss, everyone's with you. I'm sorry for your loss.  Just fyi, with the current environment, if your mom visits the doctors very often for serious medical procedures, you seriously may want to look into medical tourism and have her retire in   a place like Costa Rica or something.  They're healthcare is slightly better than the US and its a fraction of the costs.  Just something to think about in the long term if you want to perserve some of those funds. She may qualify for disability but the deadline for signing her up for the ACA is TODAY at midnight so you may want to hustle and get her an insurance plan just in case. You don't want to risk a lapse in coverage and she won't be eligible until next year in the event it takes awhile to get her on disability (and from hearing horror stories from disabled friends, it can take YEARS). Give her hugs and sweet tea and tell her you love her often. OP, if you can afford it, retain an Elder Care Attorney.  They know the ins and outs in a way that will make your life a lot better and easier.  We spent $5000, but it was well worth it.  Your cost will depend on how involved you want them to be.  The initial consultation is usually free or $200- $300 and it will open your eyes, if  anything else.\n\nThis is not only complicated,  it is also very confusing and time consuming. \n\nSorry for your loss. First of all, as others have said, take care of yourself and spend time with your family to grieve. I lost my dad suddenly a few years ago, and it's hard. It's easy to get drawn into \"OMG I HAVE TO DO ALL THE THINGS!\", and sometimes it's nice to have the distraction, but please give yourself some time.\n\nIn the short-term, get lots of copies of his death certificate (we got about 10) and have them on hand. If you're going through a funeral home, they should alert Social Security for you, but if not, that's the first thing you'll want to do once you start dealing with all of the paperwork. Also, dig out your parents' marriage certificate - a couple of institutions wanted it when transferring accounts.\n\nI'd recommend speaking with your father's employer to see what resources they offer. Many employers offer a employee support line (which can be used by any family members) to point you to resources, including legal resources and counseling. I'm not sure if you included an employer life insurance plan in your figures, but if not, determine if he had coverage through his employer as well. He may have had some leave time that could be paid out as well.\n\nBe careful when dealing with the life insurance representative - the one we worked with tried to push annuities and other investments on my mom. We took the check and ran, although we weren't dealing with nearly as much money.\n\nBest of luck through all of this. You're lucky you'll have over a million dollars to help with your situation.  Jesus man, your dad dies and you want \"take care of your mom\" too.. let her live!! There is a LOT of good information in this thread. Take care of the immediate expenses... Obviously funeral, obtaining death certificates, but also keep in mind any bills that may have been in his name. \nIf your father did not set up a will it can actually be a good thing for your mom, especially if your dad had any credit cards or outstanding balances and you live in an Equitable Division state (all but 9 states are). Basically CC companies will call and say that you have to pay up, but here's the thing... if there's no will, there's no estate... it automatically all goes to your mom. And CC companies cannot go after your mom's assets (unless you live in one of those 9 states).  So you'll be harassed, especially after cancelling accounts, but just throw the notices in the trash.\nOnce you get over the immediate things, find a financial adviser.  My wife's dad died in 2015 and basically most of the money got invested in various accounts... some short term so that we could access it, and others longer term. Her mom has health issues and doesn't work, so we needed to make sure that the money her dad did leave (and it was comparable to what you have), worked for us.  \nMy thoughts to you and yours during this time. Just take one thing at a time and breath. Can someone clarify for me how the pension works? I thought it was a guaranteed salary that your employer payed to you after you retired, but surely OP's dad wasn't guaranteed a 250k salary after he retired, so now I'm a bit confused... Today is the deadline for healthcare.gov if you're in the US. See if you can get her on ACA insurance or medicaid Other details: Be a good listener, expect repeated stories you already know by heart and a lot of loss related sadness. Expect the mourning to be long lasting, maybe several years! If you're lucky you will be able to balance the support across your family, otherwise you end up like me shouldering all the fallout yourself while your shitty siblings take a rain check.  She needs to massively scale down her spending. If she tries to keep herself in the same style that she's accustomed to she will end up broke.  Just read your post on personal finance. Your situation is complex and you need a professional. Interview a few financial advisors in your area from one of the big firms and put in place a long term plan for your mother's care. Ask them all about fees and take them into consideration but ultimately find someone who you feel is the most invested in protecting what your dad built and caring for your mom.  Go see a trust and estates lawyer who also does elder/disability/Medicaid law. Depending on your state, they can set up a trust for your mom so the money she gets from retirement, life insurance, and 401k doesn't impact her ability to qualify for social security disability income. And she can still draw from your dads money in the trust.  Okay so I'm guessing retirement age for her is either 67 or 69 so the 430k life insurance must make it for 17-19 years. that would be around 22 a year without earning interest so it is probably more on the range of 25. \nNow I don't know if this is bad advice since I don't know how bad her lupus is but you should really try to get an estimate from your doctor. If she will live (most likely, I know you can't guarantee and know for sure) her full life, then it is important to keep 401k and pension intact for retirement age. If her life expectancy is 75 well I know this is against most advice here but I would consider withdrawing 401k and pension early and try to get a boost with CD's or money markets to make up for the loses. Obviously this could be really bad advice but the general idea is that I think your mom is not going to starve. I'm following up on you, how are you doing? How's mom holding up?

A lot of people don't pick individual stocks, but I think that's the best way to do it. There's so many different strategies, but I would think long term. You can do something like pick 5 companies and buy $1000 each of their stock to get a little diversity. Pick good companies that have been around a long time. Don't think that just because a stock is expensive, that it won't go up. (like Netflix, Amazon, Google, etc). I would avoid stocks of companies under $20. Pick stocks in companies you're familiar with. I don't know anything about biotech, so I don't buy any biotech stocks. But don't just pick companies you know, make sure they have an advantage over their competitors. Also, you don't have to invest all 5k at once. Buy $500 of stock, keep the rest as cash in that account. See what happens. Get used to the rhythm of the market. Buy when you see a deal and you feel comfortable.

I feel like we have a pretty good conservative plan for the next few years, but what do I know? I'd love to hear any input or advice you all have. This subreddit has been an excellent tool for me in the past. \n\nSome background: I'm the money manager in our marriage. My salary is $60k and I have been the sole earner for the past several years. We live in a rental house. She will finish school with about $65k in student loan debt. We have no other debt. \n\nWe will most likely continue living in our rental house while we pay off her loans. We are going to try to keep our day-to-day lifestyle pretty similar to how we are currently living in order to pay off the debt as quickly as possible. Our plan is to continue using my salary to pay rent, bills, groceries, etc. and to take my wife's salary and put half of each paycheck toward student loans until the loans are gone. I estimate this will take something like 18-24 months. The other half of her money will be used for \"fun money\" on vacations and maybe a new car and other such perks. Whatever is leftover of her salary will go into a savings account. Once the loan debt is paid off, we plan to start working towards buying a house and having kids and yadda yadda. But we really just want to relax and have fun for a couple years until then. \n\nDoes this plan sound reasonable? We have no one in our lives to bounce these ideas off of. I suspect we should talk to a financial advisor at some point, but I don't know how exactly to accomplish that or when would be the right time. Quite frankly neither of us come from money, and while I think we are pretty good at being frugal, we also feel like we have no idea what we are doing.

She won't be accountable to something she didn't produce.  What's more, you lose a critical rationality check when an educated partner isn't participating in money decisions.\n\nI suppose that I'm vexed as to your debt repayment plan.  If the income will quadruple (presumably putting you at $240k), why would it take you 18-24 months to pay off your debt?  Assume half goes to taxes - why wouldn't it just take 12 months?  It wouldn't even require a lifestyle change.\n\n>Whatever is leftover of her salary will go into a savings account.\n\nYou need to budget as a household income.  At that income rate, there is 0% reason why she and you aren't totally maxing out 401(k) offerings.  Avoiding the highest taxes you're likely to pay is a major issue.  It's okay to \"relax and have fun for a couple of years\", but fully appreciate that the concept of hedonic adaptation applies.  The new income will become your normal income if you're not watching it like a hawk.  If you throttle your lifestyles up, you'll soon find that you can't find the money you need to do X.  \n\nMy advice?  Blow the debt out ASAP.  Max out all retirement vehicles that you qualify for ASAP.  Save 100% of her income for the first year, 90% for the second, and 80% for the third.  Why? Because this ensures that you guys are effectively set for financial independence.  You could buy a house with cash and have enormous cash flow opportunities.  Beyond that, review the FAQ.  The brutal truth is that medical professionals tend to be embarrassingly terrible with money.  Don't be the standard doc/PA/whatever that needs to work the 12-8AM shift at an urgent care because you can't figure out how to make ends meet on $300k a year. That's a lot of fun money. Personally I'd look at matching both your 401ks. You can still have lots of fun, but don't forget about retirement. Plus it would reduce your taxes considerably.  I'd say use less than \"half\" for fun money. If you go over to r/churning, you can go on the same trips for much less money.\n\nKids are expensive, might as well start saving for that, their college, and the home now. Wow! Mind if I ask what your wife does? Try whitecoatinvestor.com. I'm a newly graduated attending physician, so my wife and I are in a similar position, tho she's still in nursing school. \n\nSet a budget, and stick to it. You'll need a firm plan with what to do with her income, more so than half loans and half spending/saving (which, will be spending). Personally, I'd increase your spending by a relatively small amount to start, like $500/mo. You can always spend more later (and you avoid the hedonic treadmill, at least a little). Then, I'd max out all of your retirement accounts you have access to--you can afford it on your salary. After that, everything goes to student loans until they're gone--probably less than a year. \n\nWhen the loans are gone, you could spend some more of her income on your monthly expenses/needs if you'd like. Then, save for a house (or other big purchases). You'll have 20% down in a hurry. And, you're saving for retirement this whole time. \n\nOnce you've got your down payment and house bought, re-evaluate your situation. By that time, with a little bit of study, you'll be financially savvy. And, you can really direct her great income to whatever is important to the two of you--without having fallen prey to spending all your money on silly things.  * Max out your 401k's\n* Ensure you have an adequate emergency fund\n* Look at interest rates on the loans. If they are below 4% or you can refinance them to be, consider investing some of the money you would have put towards them\n* Also consider investing a good amount of what you would have just sitting in a savings account and look at getting a savings account with decent returns (I think Ally has 1%?)\n* I wouldn't waste money on a brand new car (going back a year or two will save you 20-50%), but you definitely have the money to do so\n* Start looking at homes you would want to purchase during the next year or two.

I'm still paying $500 in rent for my apartment in the city in which I used to live, which is where my boyfriend and dogs live as well. \n\nI have the option to sign a lease for a 1 bedroom for $850 beginning in August and lasting a full year. However, saving that money and staying with my parents is super tempting. I recently picked up a second job because my $2200 net monthly pay was so disappointing to me. Living on my own would make me happier, but so would paying off my car, saving up for a solid emergency fund, saving up for big future expenses, etc.\n\nWhat do I doooooo? This decision is so hard to make. It would be easier if I had my own room at my mom's, but I don't. And who knows when my boyfriend will be able to move down here and split rent with me.

I don't know why you are still paying rent at your old place. You should focus on getting a sublet or getting out of that lease if at all possible-especially if you have a lot of months left. $500 is a lot to basically just throw away.\n\nI think between having a second job, and having the potential of your boyfriend moving closer in the future, you should stay at your mom's for now. It's going to suck, but the money you'll save up will make up for it in the long run. It might be okay in the short term, but I would expect that living on an air mattress in your Mom's living room will get old pretty fast...both for you AND your Mom.  I would stay for another month or two, max, saving up every penny you can to get some savings and basic moving expenses ready.  Then start looking into an inexpensive roommate situation, something that is less than 1/3 of the take home of your primary job.  I'd shoot for like $500-$600/mo if you can.  Then you won't have to be reliant on the 2nd job in case it doesn't work out (being house/apartment poor is really stressful!), while still getting to have your own room and some privacy, AND still have money left over to finish tackling debt. Good luck! I would say you don't owe your boyfriend half of his rent. Or if you do, it is only until the end of the lease you signed together... make sure you don't just subsidize his living in another city indefinitely. Unfortunately it seems like at some point he will have to decide whether to move to your city or move on from the relationship? Unless of course you quit your new job and move back in with him.\n\nThat said, don't leave your parent's house until you have 3 months' expenses of savings and your car paid off. Maybe that will even give your boyfriend enough time to move to your city?

Get the distribution for the excess deferral. Wait for the 1099-R for it. Include that in your wages. Done. That's what it sounds like your employer's plan is, so it sounds like you're on the right track. It's just you'll include the 1099-R income in your wages which is strange, but there's a special distribution code so the IRS should know what's going on. You should just make sure your 1099-R has distribution code(s) 7 and/or 8. (I'm not totally sure what will happen... maybe you'll get two 1099-Rs.) Did you contribute 19K or your employer?

If not, request an updated W-2 form from your employer. I would just file with what you have.  Because they have sent you a check and the 1099, 'correcting' the W2 would mean the 1099 wasn't accurate.  Ultimately you're going to show on your return all of the income you actually earned between the W2 and the 1099.

In December 2016 I had to get four new tires.  Then in January 2017 I moved in with my SO, but my lease was not up until February, so I have had to pay two rents these last couple of months.

It was a checking/savings account and I had access to both through my mobile banking app. My paychecks would get direct deposited to my savings account and I would take just enough out to pay my bills with a little extra for miscellaneous use. The only problem with this was I had zero self-restraint. If I saw something I liked, I'd transfer a little more money over. If I wanted to go out with the guys, I'd transfer some more money over. By the time my next paycheck would come in, my savings account would be nearly depleted. After a few months of splurging and realizing that I didn't have a pot to piss in - I started brainstorming.\n\nIn the city I'm from there are tons of banks (almost every street corner). I found a reputable FCU about twenty minutes from my house and opened a checking/savings account (Note: My everyday bank is right down the street from me). I then had them sign a form that would allow my payroll company to deduct $150.00 directly from my account into this savings account. I started leaving the debit card for this account in my lockbox.\n\nI'm paid biweekly, so $150.00 every two weeks translates to roughly $300.00 every month which is almost $4,000.00 every year - and I barely even notice the difference on my paycheck now that I'm accustomed to it. With this you can also opt to add a little more with every paycheck. I try to go with $500.00-$750.00 every month that way if I need the money for an emergency situation I'll at least have it.\n\nYou don't have to beat yourself up and put away your whole paycheck. Having my alternate bank account relatively far away from my house makes it less convenient to go take out money unless I absolutely need it. I find myself occasionally checking my balance and determining whether I can reward myself or if I need to hit the savings a little harder.\n\nIf you guys have any tips for saving feel free to leave them below!", "title": "How I save my money without even realizing it.", "comments": "Sounds like you created a system that works good for you, congrats!\n\n> Having my alternate bank account relatively far away from my house makes it less convenient to go take out money unless I absolutely need it. \n\nJust out of curiosity: why does it matter where the branches of your bank are located? I don't think I know anyone that has set foot in a branch office in the past five years or so. It seems very outdated. Is this common in the US?   This is an excellent advice that I too had been following until just last month. Until I realized that I could save more, but how much more?\n\nSo, I changed the way my check gets split. Instead of sending the fixed amount to the savings account, I drew a budget and now send a fixed budgeted amount to my primary account while the rest goes to the savings account.\n\nThis way, I am only enticed to spend what I have budged for and my increments also go to savings. Again, the only downside is that you need to draw a budget before doing this. This isn't a bad tip, and I like your strategy.\n\nOne thing I like is Wells Fargo Way2Save or Bank of America's Keep the change program. In BofA's case they transfer the remainder of your card purchase (say it is $1.50, they automatically transfer $.50 into savings). I like this approach because it is small but every bit helps. I wish more banks offered this service. I can do it manually but it is a pain.\n\nYou could use an app like acorns which is the same concept but that gets invested into Vanguard Funds which isn't bad, but it is an option for some. Would be even better if you began putting this money in CDs every 6 months or so and creating a laddered CD.  Better interest when the interest from banks is just sad :(\n Does your FCU offer a decent interest rate? Online savings accounts are usually the route recommended on this sub since you can get a 1% interest rate. This is great! I also have some \"secret\" accounts except I use Qapital and Digit to automatically deduct a small amount from my checking account depending on my spending habits. It notices when I'm being tight on money and doesn't remove much or any and when I start spending again it raises the amount to kind of even things out. I don't save as much as you do each month but it's such small increments that I don't even notice the money missing and it's a nice small surprise when I check the balances.

I have dyscalcula so it's hard for me to figure out finance stuff, and I could really use help.\n\nSo the root of my problem: At this moment I have a little under $1000 (just paid my $800 rent) in my bank account, with no emergency fund. I spent it all in June for my new lease (first, last, security, and broker fee). I'm about to get $1700 back from my last lease ending, which I plan on putting towards my taxes this year. (Last year I paid about $1100.) I have about 20k left in student loans (all FedLoan) and I'm currently on Pay As You Earn. I haven't paid anything on my student loans since 2014, when I threw $10k at them (leftover loan money). My parents also have a ton of loan money out for me, and I feel terrible about that, but that's another story. The other day, my parents told me they have a $2k check from my grandma to give me. And I also have a Charles Schwab account with $7k in it from mutual funds from when I was a little kid that I'm now in charge of. I don't fully understand how it works, but after reading this subreddit it seems like a Target Date Fund, and I really like the thought of not touching it and letting it grow.\n\nBut I guess my question is: what do I do with the $2k check? And what do I do with my Target Date Fund? Should I open it up and put it towards my loans? Should I put the $2k in my savings? Should I open a different savings account that isn't part of my current bank to get a higher interest rate? I'm sorry if I sound like a total newb, but that's because I am. I love this subreddit and it's been helping me get it together for about a year now (yay budgeting!) but I could really use more advice. Thank you so much! \n\nTL;DR: I'm an actor and freelancer with about $1k in the bank but no current savings, $20k of Pay As You Earn Student Loans, and I've got a $2k check and a $7k Target Date Fund from my parents and am not sure what to do with them.", "title": "Finance Newbie - I have loans but also \"found\" money?", "comments": "Forgot to mention the mutual fund, I would leave it be unless you find yourself facing homelessness.

That is why I love Vanguard, they are very investor oriented (as in, they want YOU to make the money, not their advisors and brokers) and their fees are one of the lowest available. Most of their funds are at a less than .20% expense ratio, whereas I have seen other brokers charging upwards of 2% on fees. I would definitely keep the money liquid, if I were you and use it as an emergency fund. With the unpredictability in your earnings each month you need a higher emergency fund than the regular 9-5er. \n\nThere isn't a whole lot of difference in interest rates on savings accounts (I think the highest is around 1%) but you should consider where you want to keep your money. I like credit unions personally, in my experience they have great customer service and they won't nickel and dime you to death with fees. Leave the target date fund alone except if you'd like to transfer it to vanguard. u/GoneGirl_28 is spot on that if you call them they'll guide you through the process. \n\nI just checked actually and if you're in their target date index fund their expense ratio is actually lower than vanguards. If you're in that fund then you dont really need to bother to move it at all.\n\nIf you're good with money, ie you can leave an emergency fund alone and not spend it, you can keep the 2k liquid. \n\nOtherwise add it to your student loan debt. With a volatile income, I suggest you fortify your savings. You should be targeting several month's worth of expenses in your emergency fund before you worry about investing. Keep paying the absolute minimum on your loans until you have more security in your day-to-day expenses.

It sounds like you need to work through the first few steps still. Make sure you're getting the 401k match at your job, build up a 6-month emergency fund, and get the 6.8% student loans paid off. If you can refinance them at a lower rate, then great. But in the meantime, no reason to delay getting them paid off asap. I'd split your post-401k match surplus takehome pay 50/50 between building your emergency fund and paying off the student loans.\n\nOnce those are both done, bump up your 401k contributions to meet the $18k annual limit. That should get your through the next three years, then see where things stand. Live like you've been living and you'll end up pretty well off sooner than later.  It sounds like you're jumping too far ahead. You don't yet have much of an emergency fund, so the first 2-3 months of the increase should probably go there. After that, it sounds like you're more than getting 401k matching, so you may want to look at reducing those contributions (but get any match) to tackle the student debt. Then, you're at step three and you should aggressively pay off that student debt. You'll finish that up a few months from now, so use that time in between to learn about the investing stuff in step six, particularly the three fund portfolio. When you're at that point, you'll be prepared.  If you can refinance the student loan at a lower total cost (including fees) do that. If you can't refinance the loan, use the excess cash to pay off the loan over the next 12 months. Long-term returns in the stock market are about 7%, so you should be indifferent between paying off the loan and investing in the market. Once the loan is paid off sign up with a Betterment or Wealthfront and start investing in the stock market through no fee exchange traded funds.

(The fact that each of you has also some amount of withholding probably clouds this issue.)\n\n---\n\nSadly, if you enter just one W-2 and imagine you are getting a refund because of how much withholding you've had, you can sometimes be dismayed to find that you owe money after the other W-2 is added.

From my understanding, when his family moved to a new house a while back, they had some routers that they did not return when they switched from Comcast to another provider. Supposedly the routers are still at my S/O's mother's house. Now Comcast is coming after him with late fees, and I'm worried about how it may affect him and his credit since for some reason Comcast is insisting that it is in his name and not his parent's.\n\nKeeping in mind that we are both college students, (S/O is 19 and I am 18) and currently living on campus about 4 hours away from his home, we're both uncertain as to how we should go about handling this situation. Sadly, as my S/O comes from a poorer family, they are currently unable to comfortably pay the late fees (Something around $350 from my understanding). In addition, given how his mother is, I'm worried that the routers (provided they still have them) may not be returned in a timely manner. And, since I've browsed and skimmed some more popular posts about [Comcast and how they deal with these things](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2duzfi/comcasts_corporate_response_to_my_recent_reddit/), I'm worried about how we're going to take care of any late fees that arise after this issue is resolved. \n\nAs of right now, I've been trying to push for him to get on his mother about returning the routers and taking care of the late fees, as well as closing the account or taking his name off of it, but he feels like it will be fine to let it wait until he can provide his mother with the money to cover the fees. In addition, I know that my S/O has been trying to refer Comcast to his mother, but I have a feeling that Comcast isn't going to care too much about that. \n\nSo I suppose I have a couple of questions about this situation:\n\n* Is it safe to let this wait until they can come up with the funds to pay off the fees?\n\n* Is this going to affect my S/O's credit? If so, how badly?\n\n* How should we go about resolving this? Evidently the routers need to be returned and the late fees paid, but I'm worried about Comcast attempting to pile on more fees after the situation is resolved. \n\n* When we resolve this, what sort of documentation should we request to prevent any potential follow-up fees from Comcast?\n\n* If there was a scenario where the account was placed in my S/O's name *before* they were legally able to apply for loans and such (I'm assuming the age is 18), would it be possible for us to eliminate the fees entirely once the routers are returned? (Not sure if this would be something more suited for r/legaladvice, but its more a question based on scenario.)\n\nI'm highly worried about this severely damaging their credit score in the long run, and this potentially going to debt collectors if we wait too long. I'm hoping that this scenario isn't as severe as I think it is, but if it is something that we need to take care of sooner rather than later I'm hoping that this post may also give my S/O a little more of a push to get things done sooner. \n\nAny and all advice is much appreciated.

I won't comment on the actual funds themselves, but broad strokes your asset allocation looks on par with or maybe slightly more conservative than your age.\n\nHonestly from a 401k perspective your best bet is to look at investing your assets in a target date fund if your company offers one. If you're not familiar, this is essentially a fund of funds designed to diversify your portfolio appropriately based on when you want to retire. The fund automatically derisks as you age. Fees for these funds have generally declined over the past few years for these funds therefore they have become much more attractive. Unless you're a savvy investor I'd recommend going this route.\n\nAs far as your IRA question goes- I'm a firm believer in Roth for younger people- would rather get taxed now when I'm theoretically making less than I think I will at retirement. At some point it might change though. Also, if your company offers a Roth 401k option I'd suggest going with that too.\n\nFinally, I'd also like to note that contributing to an HSA is a great strategy as well - it's a unique savings vehicle in that nothing gets taxes (pretax dollars going in, no taxes on investment earnings, and no tax when you pull money).\n\nHope this helps. You were correct about the one index fund in your 401k, it is where I would put 100% of my 401k dollars if you're planning on maxing out your 401k and an ira.  I would open a vanguard ira and split it 50/50 between the total bond fund and total international fund.  The other funds in your 401k are way too pricey.  As far as roth vs traditional that's situation specific.  Going by what I know about your situation traditional makes a lot more sense,  you're not exactly a low earner and if you decide to retire early there are ways to access that money without paying any or very little tax and no penalty.

You likely pay your workplace tax first, and the full rate.  Then the city you live in may give you a full credit, or a partial credit or no credit at all, and you pay your local tax to where you live.\n\nSo example A.  Workplace has a 1.5% rate, home has 2.5, and full reciprocity.  \n\nI pay 1.5% to where I work, and 1% to where I live.\n\nExample 2.

I'm thinking more in terms of Ohio tax law right now.\n\nPA you just withhold the higher of the two rates.  KY tends to be very similar to Ohio a lot of the time. \n\nWhat state to you live in first of all?  Every state is a bit different, so I can speak in general terms, but can not give an exact answer without more information.\n\nYour employer can calculate this, and should be able to withhold the tax for you. (although you may still need to file a local return).\n\nOf course local resident withholding is sometimes optional, and some employers may not do resident withholding.  Workplace withholding is very likely to be mandatory, so they are more likely to at least be withholding that.\n\nOf course, without knowing the state, I can not comment too much on specifics.

A lot of landlords have seen so much awful pet damage over the years, many of them stop allowing pets. In some municipalities you cannot charge a pet rent for service animals.

Help/Suggestions please?", "comments": "Savings isn't typically something you do \"quickly\".  If you're trying to buy a house, putting down what you have and refinancing after another year with the same-ish amount wouldn't be a bad idea. First, save (in a savings account or money market, something easily accessible) enough for a month's worth of expenses.  Then really aggressively pay off the car (no reason to owe money if you don't have to, imo, regardless of interest rates).  Then bump up the savings to at least 6 months expenses. Trust me, it feels AWESOME to know you don't owe anyone anything and can support yourself for 6 months, if needed.  Major stress reducer, life becomes really good.  I've done this, and it feels great to know I could tell my boss to shove it tomorrow, and be totally fine.  Then start putting 15% in retirement.  I would highly recommend choosing 2-3 funds that have high 5-10 year average returns and low, low management fees (<0.5% if you can).  Vanguard ETFs are great for this, and a small or mid cap fund plus a large cap is a great place to start.  Then you save for a down payment on a house, ideally 20% (otherwise you flush money down the drain on PMI). Bonus life points: then pay off the house aggressively, and then continue saving, retire early, and life is your oyster.    FYI you won't be able to deduct Trad IRA contributions as you make too much money.  Without the ability to contribute to a 401k your options to contribute any significant amount to tax deferred accounts is limited. I personally would still max a Roth though.  \nOne of the other posters gave good advice re: emergency fund, paying off car, etc.  \n\nEdit*** Since you dont have a work sponsored retirement plan you can deduct a Trad IRA.

If you were 18 and now 28, you need to find out the date those accounts FIRST went delinquent without you bringing them current. That is the date the 7 years starts ticking from. I'm guessing these accounts should have long ago aged off your credit report. If so, you need to dispute them with the credit reporting agencies as account too old. Many times with old debt, collection agencies try to get away with putting BS dates in hoping people don't know their rights. But if you dispute them, they'll have to provide proof to the CRA and most aren't willing to fabricate documents because the penalties are stiff.\n\nOnce (actually, along with) you do that, you need to get a secured credit card. CapitalOne has a secured mastercard with no annual fee. Other big card companies have them too. Just don't go with some scam company like First Premier or some crap. Make your monthly payments on that for 5-6 months and CapOne will automatically raise your limit. After that, apply for an unsecured credit card. Make 6 months of payments on that, and your score will be solidly in the low 600s. From there, just keep building your credit. There's nothing with credit that time, patience, and a little discipline can't fix. This may be a long comment, so I apologize, but it worked for me and my husband, and could easily work for you.  Yes, a secured credit card would be beneficial, but ONLY use it when you have the cash in hand.  For instance:  You have $25 in cash to pay for gas in your car.  Use your secured credit card to charge the $25, and then use the cash to pay off the card IMMEDIATELY.  Don't ever use it for something that you do not currently have the money for.  That will bite you in the butt!  \n\nAlso, you get a free annual credit report each year that shows you everyone you owe, and how much.  If it is over seven years old, write the credit bureau a letter (you can google proper templates) asking them to remove the account due to it being over 7 years old.  As for other accounts that you do currently owe money on, send the collection agency a certified letter asking for a \"Pay for Delete.\"  This is basically saying that if you pay off the debt, they will delete it from your credit report within 15 to 30 business days.  YOU MUST SEND IT CERTIFIED.  It costs a few bucks, but it's worth it.  Google \"Pay for Delete\" letters.  \n\nIf they refuse to delete, send the letter again.  Different people work in that department, and eventually you may get someone who is feeling kind that day and willing to delete the report for the payment.\n\nIf you have exhausted that option, then send a letter offering to pay 25% of the debt in order to consider the debt as settled.  If they demand full payment, write back offering only 50%.  Look up your state's statute of limitations.  Some debt collectors LOVE to make threats and scare you into paying the full amount, but each state has a statute of limitations, which is generally from 4 to 7 years.  If these accounts are past the statute of limitations for your state (not the state that the collection agency is in), they cannot do anything to you, other than call and harass you.\n\nDO NOT MAKE ANY AGREEMENTS OVER THE PHONE.  You always want a paper trail to cover your butt.\n\nSome collectors will allow payment plans, if you would like to go that route as well, but I would try and do the first few options before going that route.\n\nIt can be a lengthy process, but it is worth it, especially if you can fix your credit and save some money at the same time.  My husband had HORRENDOUS credit when we got married, and it took several years to fix (family member had been using his credit since he was a child) and therefore it took us much longer to resolve, however, you have a much smaller debt, and should be able to resolve much faster.\n\nI hope this helps, and feel free to ask any questions! Definitely check your credit report and pursue the pay for deletes. Also check the forums at myFico. There's a ton of information there and plans for repairing credit.  Paying old debts doesn't usually help your credit score.\n\nStart with your credit reports from www.annualcreditreport.com\n\nFor charged off accounts and collections look for the date of first delinquency (DOFD) or date this item will be on file until (subtract 7 years for a good estimate of the DOFD). These sort of accounts accounts can only be on your credit report for 7 years from the DOFD.\n\nUnderstand your state's statute of limitations on the type of debt (e.g. search for: California statute of limitations credit card debt) this is the number of years from the DOFD they have to sue you.\n\nIf you haven't paid anything in 10 years then it's likely there are judgments on your credit report. With these judgments the creditors can garnish your wages and bank accounts. Judgments in most states last around 10-20 years and sometimes can be renewed. This is reason enough to take care of them. Normally I would recommend you open secured credit cards, but if you have judgments I would take care of them first since these creditors usually get copies of your credit reports, see you are doing better and then take the effort to locate you and start trying to collect. Be prepared to pay 80-100% of the balance (and interest) but try to settle for 20-30% of the original amount. Wipe your identity and get a new one from the Dark Net. It cost about 20,000 USD.

That was enough for a 1ct round cut diamond, F color, SI1 quality (the slight inclusion was positioned so that it would be really hidden behind a prong, and it is otherwise flawless... That irrelevant little thing dropped the value of the ring by $4k), set on a diamond studded band. \n\nMy jeweler offered twelve months interest free, but I used my 0% credit card to finance (the miles I accrued put us over the top so we could use them for our honeymoon airfare the following year!). I had enough saved to pay for her ring outright, but I actually wound up using some money I had saved for the ring to pay off my remaining car loan ($4k was left on that) and then put $500/mo toward the ring for 8 months to pay that off. \n\nI agree that you should avoid spending money you don't have on a ring, but if we're talking about a short payback period and zero interest, there's really no harm, assuming you pay back in the promotional period. \n\nBy the way, congratulations on the trip and on your pending engagement!  Buy a $20 ring and upgrade later when you've saved up properly. Why not look into interest free credit cards? A lot come with 18 months before interest kicks in. If you need longer than that then you could switch the card with a 0% balance transfer. Just depends on whether or not you can get the credit limit you need for the ring you want to buy her. Good luck, I hope you're both happy How long are you planning to finance it? A lot of places will finance 12 months 0% interest, at worst 6 months at 0%. Granted they jump up to the 20's after that time period. What part of the country are you in? In most major cities you'll find a certain section where all the non big box store jewelers are. Chicago has what's called jewelers row, where you can buy certified diamonds- all shapes, sizes, color, and clarity and you choose the setting and it's closer to cost than places like Kay. I'd look into that. Just make sure you are getting paperwork on what you buy. I'd hope you have some saved up and this would be a more financial beneficial route, but if you don't then def. a nice promise ring is also a great gesture.  Ask her family if you can borrow a ring (mom's, grandma's, great-grandma's, whatever), propose and tell her you want to pick out the ring together (make sure you discuss price first). This gives you more time to save up. \n\nThis is how my husband proposed to me and it was fun to go look at rings together. Plus I got exactly what I wanted. Which I ended up preferring the white sapphire (most people think it's a diamond. Great quality stone for a third the price)  If you approached your company and explained the situation to them, would they consider giving you an advance on your paycheck to buy a ring?\n\nNot really finance advice, but one thing to keep in mind is that she may actually prefer to be asked without a ring, or with a heirloom temporary ring, and get to choose her own, particularly if she's fussy. Three of my friends got engaged this year, only one of them is truly happy with the ring her fianc\u00e9 picked, the other two don't really like theirs and wish their partners had proposed without one and chosen it together later! This would buy you time to save up for it.\n\nI definitely would describe myself as fussy and would also prefer a ringless proposal to getting stuck with a ring I don't like for the rest of my life. One thing I do like the sound of though is a proposal with just the diamond, and getting to design the setting for it myself afterwards. Might be something to look into if the cost of the diamond alone is something you could realistically save up for by then. Often the jeweler can put a diamond into a temporary setting for you so you'd have a ring to propose with, but she'd get to chose her final setting later. I recognize your question is focused on how to approach paying for or financing a ring, but I wanted to also encourage you to do some research on who/where to buy from and what to look for in your search.  Although your timeline is short, the mark-ups in the diamond engagement ring market is significant... and big-box stores are guaranteed to charge you the most for the lowest quality.  Take some time and look into pricescope.com to understand the market and get some ideas of reputable sellers to get the best for your budget.   Folks there can also help you with recommendations and advice.   Another option to consider is the resale market.  I have a couple sites I've used and have saved over 50-60% from retail - including sale prices.  Trust me, you'll be glad to save that difference; it'll help contribute towards the wedding budget!  Good luck. :) Don't.  \n\nEngagement rings are absolutely pointless......just think logically for second.

There is usually a waiting period, so you want the clock to start as soon as possible. I can't answer your questions, but see this as the jumping off point it can be.  I once was laid off and had a new, better paying job to go to the next week, and had a promotion there in a year.  You can either use this as a \"Nobody likes me\" moment or an \"I'll show them what a mistake they made\" moment.  Choose the latter, work your ass off, and great things will happen. You need to apply for unemployment NOW. Like literally now.\n\nUnemployment is NOT retroactive to the day you got laid off. Only to the day you APPLY. (at least in Texas. It's similar in most other states I think)\n\nI cost myself almost $2k that way because I waited a month first because of shame. Don't make the same mistake! Ok..  Let's start with this. \n\n1. Most of the time,  no you can not negotiate your own severance. Doesn't hurt to try. \n2. Your 401k stays with the company, where you CAN keep it but it may be more beneficial to transfer it out to your financial institution \n3. Your FHA doesn't get anything else contributed,  but you can use what's left. \n4. Personal days don't get paid for,  but vacation days do.  However,  expect this to be part of the severance. \n\nI'm probably missing a point but that's a good start  Good luck! I was in a similar boat not that long ago (well I guess a while ago).  My boss, who I am friendly with, also was let go.  She and her boss gave me the pep talk of my life and helped me get my resume to a stellar place and realize what an asset I was to whoever got me next.  They also encouraged me to take some time and mentally get over what happened, and really think about my next career move.  Which I did.  My severance helped that.  They really made me think about the type of employee and company I wanted to work for.  And when I found that, I went for it.  I didn't just apply for anything that I thought I could do.  I know that is a luxury not everyone has, but it I think it honestly helped me in the long run, because I've been here at my current gig almost 6 years and I love it! Sorry to hear it.\n\nMy only advice is that your new job is finding a job:  get up in the morning, shower, get dressed, and go forth.  No lazing about.  No being sloppy (unless that is your natural state).\n\nAlso, apply for unemployment immediately.\n\nIf you are in a metro area, start looking up startup company expos and events - they are great for networking. Getting laid off sucks. people here already pointed out you should file for unemployment.\n\nI will share a story, maybe it will help.\n\nin 2001 I was managing a department of about 4 people. I got a general vibe that things were not good there, so I started passively looking for a new job. I interviewed at a mortgage service company and got a job offer for a few buck more than what I was currently making. I turned that one down. I also knew this guy that had a business. He was in his mid 50's and I was pretty sure he didn't have a succession plan.\n\nI was laid off 3 days before Christmas 2001. I was devastated. I had been working since I was 13 years old. I was never unemployed.\n\nI met with the business owner and floated the idea of buying him out. This was kinda funny since I was in my 20's, unemployed,  and didn't even have any money. I told him, I don't have any money, but I do have 2 things you need. I have the experience to run this company. I was basically doing it (or something like it) since I was a teenager, and more importantly. I have time.\n\nI'm in my 20's. if you finance the deal, I will be able to pay you a fat pension (via promissory note) that will probably exceed your life and will get paid to your heirs if you die.\n\nI went to work for him in 2002. He sold me the business in 2010. In 2014 I opened a second business.\n\nThe moral of the story is simple. When I lost my job, I had nothing left to lose, no velvet trap.\n\nThere is nothing to hold you back now.\n\n    \n\n probably wont see anything for the personal days. only way you can negotiate severance is if you threaten to sue, is there a reason to sue? enjoy being unemployed get your resume in order and get on it 100% negotiate your severance. I was laid off a month ago. My company was offering 1 month, I asked for 2 and got it just because I had the balls to ask. I got laid off back in 1998 from a company I really liked. Had 6-months of a non-compete left / on my back, a 3-year old at home and a wife that wasn't working and was going to college.  Scared the heck out of me.  Here's what I did:\n\n---Immediately filed for unemployment as it becomes effective X days (don't remember how many) from the day you file, not from the day you're laid off.\n\n---Let all my friends (and now-a-days Linkedin contacts and Facebook too of course) know that I was laid off and looking for X type of job opportunity.  Make it public that you're searching.  The average person tends to do the opposite.\n\n---If you need continued heath insurance use COBRA.  Check with HR folks, but if still the same you have up until the 90th day to apply.  They they'll bill you retroactively back to the start date you applied.  But you have 60-ish days to pay it.  If you/family remain healthy all that time and you get a new job with health insurance then don't ever pay the invoice.  If you do need the insurance then pay the invoice and the coverage is RETROACTIVE BACK TO DAY #1. Your credit won't get hurt as gov't / cobra treats it as if you just never applied if you don't pay the invoice.  This is a risk free way to get 5-6 months of potential coverage, but only if you need it (cuz you'd only pay after you see you actually need it).  This is a COBRA loophole that isn't publicized; read up on the \"apply / invoiced / pay by\" rules to make sure it's still the same, but I think it is.\n\n---Eventually roll over your company 401-K to a rollover IRA at either Vanguard or Fidelity or Schwab (the 3 low-cost big investment companies that all offer no/low fees and some free financial advice if you need it).\n\n---Hit the ground interviewing and also think about possibly starting your own biz...or both.\n\nWhat I ended up doing:\n\n---All of above.  I interviewed with 6-7 companies while starting my own biz at the same time as the economy sucked in my business sector at that time.  After about 6 months decided to stick with the own business route as no love with any killer employment offers.  Best thing I ever did as we've had our (wife/self) business for 18-ish years now.  I could have retired comfortably 5-6 years ago but enjoy what I do so figure I'll keep doing it for 2-3 more years until youngest child is safely through first year of college and then... Before you get too far removed, make a list of the highlights of what you accomplished in the 5 years there. Also, if possible get your job description, as this may be helpful for resume. Also, think about everyone you worked with the past 5 years and if there's any opportunity to network for your next job. > Does my flexible health spending account go kaput?\n\nSo is this a \"flex spending account\", or a health savings account for high deductible health plan?  If it's the flex spending, then yes, kaput.  However, if it's an HSA (which usually come with a debit card for their use), then you get to keep it and keep every sent!\n\nCompanies will usually pay out all your vacation days - anything banked - when you get laid off.  However, some companies have an employment agreement which limits what they'll pay out on termination.  Your severence information that you're getting in the mail will likely quanitfy that.\n\nI've never heard of anyone negotiating a severence package.  If you're in a right-to-work state (and I think Texas is one of those states), then honestly anything you get is better than the law requires.\n\nBy way of encouragement, I was also laid off from a five year job that I loved.  That was three years ago.  I was lucky and found a new job in less than 2 months, and got to bank most of my severence.  (My old job continued paying me for 2 months after the layoff.)  My new job also ended up paying better than the last job, so it turned out to be a great career move.  Sure - right now the uncertainty SUCKS, but while you have financial security to be picky, be picky!  Turn this into a career move up! > Do I need to do anything with my 401k?\n\nIf your account is very small, your company may send you a check.  **This is not what you want.**  Roll it into an IRA if your account is too small (you can find out the minimum size by talking to your plan administrator).\n\nOtherwise, there is no hurry.  Keep it there, roll it into an IRA, or roll it into your next company's qualified retirement plan.\n\nMake sure you read the relevant [wiki article on rollovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/retirementaccounts/rollovers) for more information.\n\nThis is just a draft wiki page at this point, but /r/personalfinance/wiki/leaving_job may also be helpful.\n\nGood luck. Only advice I can offer is to make SURE the company is claiming it is a layoff. I was hosed by a company that claimed I was fired instead of laid off despite telling me I was being laid off. I didn't know any better and filed for unemployment....guess what I had to PAY BACK two months later? All of the unemployment I had collected and already spent on bills. I received a call and letter stating that the employer contested it and said I was fired, not let go. Crippling since I hadn't yet been able to build up savings.\n\nKeep your head up OP! End of the day, it was the best thing to ever happen to my career. Fell into a job I absolutely love afterwards that I would've never gone for otherwise! Best of luck! Just an FYI, although you should definitely apply for unemployment so that your claim is open and ready to go, I don't think you can get unemployment while receiving severance pay. At least that's how it works in Ohio. You don't want to get socked with paying back unemployment, or getting docked unemployment, so you should check on that. Please look into this and don't just trust me.  \n\nI've heard that you have something like 3 months to actually sign up for Cobra insurance.  If buying your own insurance or cobra is going to be really expensive I think you can just want and sign up if you happen to need it.  \n\nThere is the whole ACA no insurance penalty which I don't know much about but I just wanted to throw this out there. You should roll your 401k over into a traditional IRA. It will be less expensive fee-wise and you'll have more control over where your money goes.

It's never smart to cosign, especially in this case where there is no backing asset. Only cosign if you are (or could be) okay with gifting them the loan amount. I know that sounds harsh, but if this turns out to be a mistake, which is how arrangements of this sort often resolve, this mistake would haunt you for a very long time.  If you cosign, you will end up paying the entire amount of the loan when they cannot.  If you are asking to be cosigned, the bank has already judged that they are a poor risk to pay the  loan themselves.  Your description certainly conforms that.

I've been reading Reddit on a different account for a while now, and every now and then, I see someone seeking help or suggestions on PF, and you guys have always been very helpful. So I hope I can find some suggestions here. \nAnyway, here's the situation my family is facing:\nWe live in the San Francisco Bay Area, me, my wife and our 2-year-old kid. My wife just quit her job last year to take care of the kid, and I'm making close to 120k a year, but after tax, retirement, health issuance and everything, my paycheck is about 2.5k every two weeks. I'm participating a small promotion soon which will boost my salary to around 135k a year. We have a house which mortgaged in 2013. The loan has about 500k left on it, and it was at 3.5% 30 years fixed. Monthly payment is 2.3k and property tax comes in about 9k a year. We have about 450k \"cash\" sit on our bank account and stocks. The reason it was sitting there was because we were trying to buy a second house as an investment. Since a lot of you guys know, the house price in Bay Area has been skyrocketing and we were so close to getting that investment house couple times but just couldn't (out bid etc.) \n\nNow, to make the situation more complicated, my mom is trying to \"gift\" us half of her house. Half is because she owns the house with her boyfriend and they are seeking to sell it. We can either buy the house with paying her boyfriend half of the price of the house, or they will sell it and my mom will give the money to us. The house is in a bad condition, a 50-60k is needed to make it in a good living condition. The current market value is about 300k, maybe a tide lower because of the bad condition.\n\nWhat we trying to do is not sitting on the big pile of cash and put them into some investment not just for my kid's education but also for a better living for our family in general.\n\nSo far, our options are: \n \n   1. Buy my mom's house, fix it and rent it out. The rent could be close to 2k a month. After HOA, property tax,    cost etc. it should give us about 1.2k income per month. Use our money that's sitting in the bank to buy a third house/condo and rent it out as well, on this investment we probably won't break even cash wise since the mortgage + cost is going to be slightly more than what we can rent it. \n   2. Buy the house, fix it and sell it. And buy a better and bigger investment house. \n   3. Buy the house, fix it and then rent/sell. Don't buy another house since the market is too hot. Put them into some other investment (stock, bond). \n   4. I guess option 4 can go with any of the above options. Open an educational investment account( forget the exact name of it) for the kid. Base on the conversation we had with the guy in our bank, the amount we put there will double every 7 years. We know it's not guaranteed, but the earning is tax-free from educational spending.\nAlso, about my mom's house. What's the best way for us to receive the value of it? Do we direct buy from my mom and the boyfriend at a discounted price? Or is there a way for my mom and her boyfriend gift it to us so we don't have to go through the process? \n\nAnyway, sorry for the wall of text.

Going into this year, I knew my wife and I were going to owe money, as this is my first complete year of work after graduate school. However, we were not prepared to see how much we expect to owe the state and fed. After double checking to see if I entered everything correctly, it was clear that we were owing far more than I had anticipated. We will have to dig into our savings for a house, which we hate to do.\n\nSo here\u2019s what we have. Our wages come in at 112K, not including 2.5K in additional earnings from interest in housing savings and mutual fund investments. We were able to subtract 3.2K from my wife\u2019s IRA deduction and 2.5K from student loan interest, but despite the standard deduction and exemptions, the 88.3K of taxable income leads us to eventually owe the feds 3.7K\n\nTurboTax suggests contributing to an IRA through April to increase our deductions. I can certainly encourage my wife to increase her contributions but with my employer\u2019s retirement (pension) plan, I cannot deduct more than 900 dollars should I open an IRA.\n\nAlthough 112K is a decent income, living in Los Angeles in a one-bedroom apartment certainly doesn\u2019t make us feel wealthy. As I mentioned earlier, we are saving for a house and we are both despondent at having to owe close to 6K. Furthermore, our first born is due to arrive in March, which will definitely put a dent in our finances (but one we welcome).\n\nIs there anything we can do to owe less money aside from increasing IRA contributions? What suggestions can you provide so that we can owe less money in the future without having to dip too much into our house/emergency savings?\n\n*EDIT: My wife just informed me that she never updated her W-4 after I started working. Explains why we owe so much. We plan to visit our respective HRs tomorrow.*", "title": "Owing over 3.7K to feds and 2.2K to state in taxes. Am I doing this wrong?", "comments": "You can submit a form W-4 to your employer to adjust the amount of tax that is withheld from your pay. If you set this number correctly, you will neither owe nor be owed any significant amount of money at the end of the year when you file your tax return. What were you claiming on your W-4? If you both went married and one that's probably your issue since it'll underwithold. If you claimed more than that you definitely just messed up.\n\nHonestly aside from what you already pointed out - There's not a lot you can really do. Obviously fix your withholdings so you don't have an issue again next year. You should probably go Single and 1 (to be on the safe side) or at the very least Married and 0. The reason is that you're both withholding assuming an individual income IE 60,000 + 60,000. When in reality your combined income of 120,000 puts you into a higher tax bracket and thus you underwitheld.\n\nThe \"savings\" for a house thing is kinda a moot point, since the only reason you saved is because you underpaid your taxes.\n\nThere's lots of free tax estimating calculators online, I'd use one and get your W-2's straightened out ASAP. It sounds like your W-4 is off for you and your spouse. Pull them up again and see how many deductions you've taken and reduce them. There are plenty of online calculators to help you figure out the number of deductions you should take, but I'd take one less then that just to be on the safe side (so if the calc says you can take 2, I'd just take 1). I know it's writing the feds a 0% interest loan, but I'd much rather get a refund then owe money so I've always errored on the side of paying more over the year and then getting funds back. The IRS has a two earners worksheet specifically for this.  I'd recommend both running married 0 then choose one paycheck to withhold extra from.  Similar incomes we withhold an extra 300 a month for this.  Ensure you also contribute to your 401k to lower your taxable income.\n\nThe married withholding assumes only one person is earning an income while the other isn't. There are some people who believes owing as much as possible without going into penalties is Winning.\n\n When you say earnings from investments, are you talking about the value of your 401k / IRA going up? Usually you don't need to pay taxes on your retirement account until you start withdrawing from it.\n\nAlso, don't forget to deduct state income tax from your federal. Are you able to pay the federal and state liabilities on time? The ira isn't through your work. You open it with an investment company. There are 2 types, roth and traditional. Roth doesn't effect your taxes right now. Both of them have a contribution limit of $5500 per person and you can contribute for 2016 until April 14 It seems to already have been addressed / mentioned, but my wife and I make 145k (taxable) in CA. We file jointly and just using the standard deductions would get a 1k return (just from fed). Something is off with your W-4s and withholdings. \n\nFYI, we both use single 0 since we rent as well and have no kids. The W4 form also has a place to hold out specific dollar amounts so you can set your deductions to zero and withhold even more so you end up closer to the required amount.\n\nNobody ever said that those forms estimates would fit every bodies situation.\n\nAre you really sure you did your taxs correctly, maybe just this time have them prepared by somebody as a double check. I know everyone already answered this, but a family member was in the same situation. My first question to her was, \"well, you're in the 15% tax bracket. Is over 10% of your income being taken out from your W4 submission?\" Now, the bracket is tiered, so you're taxed 10% on the first $9,000 of income, and then 15% on the remainder up to $38,000 so it's not exactly 15% that should be taken out, but if it's 8%, then you can quickly see where the leak is.

These people pay a cost *in money* for this motivational feeling, because they are not using Avalanche. Paying the highest rate cards off first while not incurring any late fees or missed payment fees for the others is the financially best option.\n\nSo if all the rates are the same, then pay the lowest balance off first so as to eliminate the debt and lower your risk of incurring fees.

I make 1800\u20ac a month net. I am not sure of gross. I have about 55.000\u20ac in savings and not a single debt anywhere. I had a student loan which was granted to me after i graduated. I am a bachelor of engineering through IT and work in a small gaming company, knowing i can easily get 2100\u20ac net elsewhere if i gave up the game part and went for a regular programming job. (But that would kill me inside most likely)\n\nI am still living at home, costing me nothing but being a burden to my parents and paying my car related expenses. I can thus almost fully save anything i earn. Usually around 1500\u20ac a month or more.\n\nAll i know is that i want to move out. And that i want to do it with my girlfriend. She has about 10.000\u20ac in savings and is still a student due to medical issues that got prolonged. If she finishes and starts working, she too should be able to easily clear 2000\u20ac  net a month and has a job guarantee of 99%, and with big pay increases in the future (medical studies)\n\nOn my own i recall i could loan about 140.000\u20ac and with my girlfriends part we could probably do 250.000 safely? I am not that sure on loaning though, it's been a while since i ran numbers. It was for 30 years and at a fixed rate if i recall correctly.\n\nWe want to build our own house. We want to stick to our hometown, and all houses for sale are old farm houses with bad insulation and such. The monthly cost would be huge. We also want to have a stand alone house due to us wanting our privacy.\n\nThis all obviously costs a lot. We researched ground prices and they are at 260\u20ac per m2. The area we could build in is a fixed 25m long and 13 meters wide at the least (can be expanded on) so ground alone would cost us around 85.000\u20ac.\n\nWe would then like to build \"select\" i am not sure how that translates but basically a house with a fixed layout or mostly fixed, which allows the costs of building it to go way down. But up until now we know it will probably still cost over 200.000\u20ac for the house. And that would be without anything in it. Just key ready. Needs bathroom and kitchen and whatever else you want done.\n\nLong story short expensive, young couple (long term couple though by now) and very aware of the costs and burden it brings.\n\nNow to the financial issue. Technically we could probably pull this house off. But it would also mean that we have to sink our savings and possibly take out the maximum legally alowed loan to do so.\n\nBesides this i have nothing planned. I have no seperate thing to build towards my retirement. If i do so i have to do it myself. And i know nothing about how or where to do that.\nWhat i DO know is that 1 generation older then my parents were alle screwed over and lost most of there retirement if not all due to the crisis a few years back. Basically i gathered that nearly all retirement plans recommended by banks and such were completely backed by stocks. The stock market went down, and gone was all the money. Only scraps remained.\n\nTogether with that i knew before the crisis tou could still invest through the bank in safe options. Which were like: invest 10.000, get it back in 5 or 10 years guaranteed. Any profit made by your investment gets deposited towards you.\nNow, the only option left is agressive high risk stocks. I am not one for gambles so no thanks on that.\n\nSo here i am. I want just 1 thing. I know nothing besides basic economics and to keep savings for a rainy day and to plan ahead. But the one thing i want goes to take the biggest risk we ever would take.

This would be best done with advice or help from a lawyer.  The bank may be willing to agree to a much more lenient payment plan, for example, in exchange for not having to go to court.

You can claim up to $1000 of expenses if you have two qualifying dependents, but if you have only one qualifying dependent, you cannot claim the credit at all. This is because the dollars from the FSA reduce your limit for the credit. See https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p503.pdf.\n\nETA: Just to clarify, you can't \"double dip\" the same dollars.

Maybe I misunderstand the question, but don't wait to pay it off.  If you have some of that $3000 now, pay that today. As the money comes in, pay it down immediately. The faster you pay it the less interest you will accrue. Paying $2000 today and $1000 next month will save you more than paying $3000 next month.\n\nAlso, it's worth noting that if you feel you will be able to continue using credit cards responsibly, you can improve your credit score by using them for purchases you would be making otherwise, and then paying off the *statement balance* each month.  The benefit of this is that you will have some credit utilization on your credit report, showing that you are using the cards and making regular payments, but you will also pay zero interest as long as you pay the statement balance each month.\n\nThis is different than paying the card off completely each month, because there is about 2 weeks between the statement date and the due date. So if your statement comes on the 1st and the payment is due on the 15th, maybe you owed $300 on the 1st and then you spend another $150 over the next two weeks. On the due date you owe $450, but you only have to pay the statement balance of $300 in order to avoid interest.  That remaining $150, and whatever you spend before the next statement, will get paid next month.\n\nAlso, don't close any of your credit cards once you have paid them off.

They take up space and make extra mess. And you shouldn't be paying twice as much for a room that is only 50% bigger. But your extra roommate should be accounted for. The extra roommate fee is also a good way to handle if a single roommate decides to move in their SO.\n\n Personally I think the smaller split room should pay more for two reasons: first, that room gets its own bathroom, and second, when two people share a room the room should cost more because two people have more impact on a shared household than one does, by far. \n\nThat said, I think that by the same token what you are paying is fair. You have a larger room with private space, two people, and a private bathroom that will never have to be shared with guests or anything. \n\nMy suggestion: that smaller split room pays an extra $100 which goes into a fund for household stuff like toilet paper, snacks, whatever. Shared stuff for everyone. Do a Costco run every month or two with the money.  https://www.splitwise.com/calculators/rent\n\nI find this nifty thing. \nGoes into detail on room size, who has a private bath, common area size, etc. \n\nGive it a shot and compare to the numbers people said below.  \n\nI do want to say that any rooms with a private bath should pay a little extra.  Two of the bedrooms will have to share one bathroom.  Sounds fair. Aside from the room size difference, you're also two people, so it's fair for you to pay more from that perspective too.\n\nI'm guessing this will be unsustainable, because people don't really share single rooms these days. Someone's going to get annoyed with that eventually. This should have been hashed out and agreed upon before everyone signed the lease and moving plans have already been finalized.\n\nThat said, I would argue that it's fair. There are a lot of things you and your girlfriend aren't going to need two of (bed for example), so the actual space you end up with could realistically be on par/more than what your roommates might have. The private bathroom is a godsend and a benefit you can't overlook either. It's not just a question of 2 people using each bathroom. It's a bathroom that you essentially have to yourself and don't have to be concerned about a roommate's schedule with. i really appreciate all of your opinions you guys.

I have been pondering this for years now and would like some input from Reddit. \n\nI'm one of those people who hates the idea of debt. As a working class guy just finishing school, I'll have a decent job in a year (bartending right now.) My wife is a nurse so we are on track to be solid middle class in terms of finances. Every time we do the math, the interest, fees, and insurance basically kill the investment. To us it doesn't seem worth the sword of Damacles hanging over our heads in terms of career, freedom, and lifestyle that we want for ourselves. \n\nI guess my question is this: Can two working class people build wealth without massive debt? If we rent an affordable place, couldn't we save and invest to such a degree that we build wealth with low risk?  \n\nRight now we can easily put away $300-$500/month and probably more in the future. Neither of us come from wealthy families, but we do seem to have decent financial discipline. I'm 32 she's 30 and our net worth is around 20k in savings retirement portfolios worth about 40K so roughly 60k. Right now we are trying to decide whether or not to buy a house in a market that should see values increase, but this is always a gamble. We just don't like the idea of being forced to pay off this massive debt as servitude style workers and the desperation that comes with it (working a job you hate, taking a career path based on fear, feeling the stress of the debt). Both of my brothers have decent careers, but went along with the \"real estate is wealth\" mindset. Right now both are late 30's with net worths hovering around $-250k. I assume that once they pay down their mortgages this will be drastically changed, but they are both working 50-60hrs a week (with no end in sight) and taking a lot of shit at their jobs, one with threats of outsourcing and downsizing. I watched this happen and it helped to form my fear of debt.\n\nThank you for any advice or input. \n", "title": "Building wealth without a mortgage.", "comments": "A mortgage is not bad if you put 20% down to not pay PMI and you are planning on living there for 5+ years. In that case you will likely come out ahead of renting. You also do need to stretch your budget. You could buy something midsize and pay it off in 15 years. Are you including the value of their homes when you compute your brothers' net worth?  If you have a 250k mortgage on a 400k property, that adds 150k to your net worth.  If they're really -250k, something else is wrong.\n\nBuying a home isn't as important as you seem to think though.  Don't do it if your aren't completely sure it's what you want. I wouldn't call myself \"pro-real estate,\" but I do advocate home ownership as a piece of wealth building. One reason I don't see mortgages as some kind of \"debt servitude\" is that no matter what, you will have constant cash flow being allocated to having a roof over your head, rent or own. While some risk is unavoidable, there are conservative approaches to home ownership to make the downside fairly negligible and you generally pay less in interest/taxes/insurance. Most people who get into trouble are owning homes they have no business owning. \n\n\nFor home ownership, I'd define conservatism as <30% DTI ratio, <80% LTV ratio, avoid property that's seen >10% increases year-after-year, or >20% increases period. If you have to rent for several more years to achieve such a conservative posture, then no big deal, keep renting away!

You have to report all gifts over $14,000 (as r/DeluxeXL points out), ($28,000/yr if you and your wife both give), but this does not mean you will need to pay taxes, the amount over $14k just reduces your lifetime gift exemption (which is north of $5m).\n\nI agree with keep the capital in your name and give your mom some money every year.

Also, you could open a brokerage account for your brother, fund it with a small amount of money, and let him contribute to it?

This will be my first experience saving for retirement so I'm sorry if there is an easy answer, I did look through the \"READ THIS FIRST\" section. My issue is deciding how much to contribute. The advice that I've found here/online is:\n\n*Contribute up to the matching amount, then move forward in  [this](https://i.imgur.com/CcEVQAV.png) flowchart\n\n*If there is no matching, max out a Roth IRA first\n\nI'm still looking for a better explanation, but HR explained it as: at the end of the year, depending on company performance, they will match X% of my contribution (not my salary).

I hope to buy a home within the next 5 years, so I can't just throw every available penny at retirement.\n\n\nUPDATE: To clarify, my question is how much I should be looking to put in the 401(k) before maxing out a Roth IRA, considering I don't have a \"match\" number to meet.", "title": "Strange 401(k) system, can't find advice on how to move forward", "comments": "Since there's no cap, unlike most matching schemes, there's not a definitively correct answer to the question you're asking. The more you put in, the bigger your match is, all the way up to $18k. \n\nYou'll have to choose for yourself where you want to cut off the free match money vs. contribute to a Roth IRA vs. save in cash for the house. The most 'free money' you can get is somewhere between $1,440 (they match 8% of contribution and you contribute $18,000), and $2,700 (they match 15% and you contribute $18,000).\n\nGenerally, it is desirable to put 15% of salary into retirement funds if possible.  (Don't know how old you are, nor how much you already have in retirement funds).  If your salary were $120,000, 15% would be $18,000, and you would get the maximum match possible from your company.  If your salary is less than $120,000 I guess you might see if you can contribute 15% and get as much match as that gets you. \n\n There so no reason to contribute to a Roth IRA while there is still match in your 401k. 8% is essentially a free year of returns.  I would put in 10% of your salary and then move on to the next step of the flowchart. It's more or less a suitable number for retirement, and it hopefully means that you get an extra percent of salary (the match by your employer).

Since then he's shored up his estate with some pretty serious estate planning and told my sister and I exactly what we should expect if he were to pass. Basically, when he dies I get my grandmother's house (which he's been renting), my sister gets his house, we use his estate's cash to pay off any debts and funeral costs and split whatever's left. We're his only heirs so if he didn't have the will things would be largely the same.\n\nFor you the situation may be different. If you're his only child you're probably his sole heir so you'd get the house. Any debts he has at death would have to be paid by the estate (via life insurance policy, your father's savings, etc) but you'd get to keep everything left over. If you have siblings and if there's no will you'll have to split the remainder with whoever else is an heir. If there is a will your father may dictate who exactly gets what and there's a slight chance he might have cut you out entirely and left his entire estate to his dog.

House maybe. \n\nWhen someone dies, generally everything they own and owe goes to their \"estate.\" The estate is an entity that uses the person's assets to pay off their debts and figure out what's left over, basically. \n\nYou might end up being the executor (person in charge of the estate) or your dad might have appointed someone else in his will. The executor makes sure the estate is all in order, and that anything in the will is divvied out properly. \n\nMost likely in your case you will be executor and you're the only heir (from what it sounds like)? Whether there is a will or not. If your dad owes a lot of debt you will have to pay that from the estate, including selling the house if there's no other money to pay debts with. \n\nIf the estate has a negative balance at the end because debts are higher than assets, you don't inherit those debts. They disappear. \n\nMind you, I'm no expert and I'm not in the US, so grain of salt with every word of this please.

Talk to your father about this. I know it's hard to do, but it's best for both of you. Been there friend. It sucks, but it's the reality.\n\nFirst you want to check on the will. Is it up to date?

You're getting to invest in funds that have lower fees than pretty much any other fund available, including Vanguard (someone correct me if I'm wrong!). The C, S, and I funds are all pretty standard fare relative to other funds, so the cheap expense isn't causing you to miss out on something. They should track the markets they represent well. You can also rebalance as often as you like if that's your thing. \n\nThe cons are choice since you really only have a few funds to choose from. I also am not sure I'd go with their target retirement funds as they seem pretty conservative, but maybe others want to critique that thinking. I guess the con also might be that you could be taking home more money to spend by using it. That's a different discussion. \n\nLots of people believe in low-cost index funds, and you won't really find a much lower cost option than those in the TSP.\n\n\n Your TSP is your money. Your pension is the government's money that they can choose to give to you or unilaterally alter the agreement at any time in the future without your permission. There has already been talk about changing the way military members pull a  retirement paycheck while  simultaneously working full time for the  government. They want to cap how much you can make. \n\nAs of 2018, new recruits aren't even getting a pension, just the 401(k). It would be a huge mistake to not diversify your retirement portfolio, and to rely completely on getting a pension for decades. Many states have already reneged on their pension agreements, and it's not inconceivable that the federal government would someday as well. \n\nWill the 4% matching starting next year affect you at all?

What was the deductible?\n Using comparables from autotrader can also help in increasing your insurance settlement  [deleted] Piggy-backing on this topic with some additional suggestions: Research comparable cars for sale in your region of the country to make sure they are offering you a fair settlement. Take notes every time you talk with the adjuster (time, date, amount offered). Also, be patient. Do not rush to accept their first (or second or third) offer. Insurance companies are regulated by the state Department of Insurance. The DOI measures insurers based on the \"number of claims resolved within 30 days.\" It is common for adjusters to sweeten a settlement as you approach the 1-month mark, because they want to get it off the books. If you are trying to reach a settlement and the insurance company (yours or the other driver's, does not matter) is not \"acting in good faith to make you whole\" then file a complaint with the DOI and they will assist. I got my car from 4.5k to about 11k. Do your research and be a thorn in their side. Eventually they will use whatever discretion they have to get rid of you. Do not take their word for it. Find your own comparable cars and show them to the agent. I must have had 10 offers from the agent before I settled. He was pissed, but it paid off in a big way for me. All that work was worth 6.5k.  Thanks for this. I am actually dealing with this right now. Guy hit my car in a parking lot. His insurance company has already said it was his fault and we just sent in our estimate for the damage. Now we're at the wait and see stage to see if they'll do the repairs or call it totaled (my guess is totaled). I've written off 2 cars. First one the offer seemed low so I didn't accept right away and did some research about write offs. The offer was $9700 and we still owed $10,000. Not a great situation.\n\nFound a good post on reddit, and asked for their valuation in writing. Well, they had us down as the wrong trim, left off nearly every option our car had and had based their comparables entirely off of the next trim level down from ours.\n\nI informed them of the mistakes, corrected them,  of the similar vehicles in my area when adjusted for mileage. They accepted and after taxes our payout was doubled.\n\nIt might have been an honest error but we switched companies after that.\n\nCut to 4 years later, just 2 weeks ago and I got rear ended at a stop sign. Over 15,000 in damage and they are writing off my car. I prepared for the worst and spent several hours getting a spreadsheet in order with all compatible vehicles I could find. There were none with our trim (base) in the entire province so I had to expand my search. Nationally, the average came to 14,200 so I expected to ask for that after their initial offer.\n\nOffer came in at 15,900 plus HST. They provided the valuation without me asking along with the offer. Everything was accurate except they seemed to value my vehicle based on the higher trims available in the area. Since this model, especially in those higher trims holds its value exceptionally well we made out better than expected. I paid 16,900 plus tax for it in 2013 and got 15,900 plus tax in 2017. Not bad at all especially as the car was paid off.\n\nSo it can really vary from carrier to carrier but it pays to know your vehicle's value. Awesome. When I wrecked my 2003 Town and Country minivan in 2016 I was offered $1600 CAD, I fought tooth and nail due to a few repairs in the last 2 years and after about 6 or 7 weeks I got an offer for $2800. Obviously you need to be able to purchase something else meanwhile if you are going for the long game. Cheers! >Tip 2 - Submit recepits for enhancements/upgrades\n\nThis wouldn't apply to modifications would it?  Like power modifications?  I thought I'd have to add coverage if I wanted that stuff covered.  I have about $8,000 in engine/exhaust parts on a $36,000 car and I assumed I would get nothing over stock value if it was totaled.  My tires are a little over a grand so that's nice to know I guess. Always put together a document with real world examples of similar cars and their prices.  Add on taxes and registration fees.  This would be similar to any document an appraiser puts together for cars or houses.  It is just a listing of comparable nearby property with their prices and taxes.\n\nThat is what they reasonably owe you.  You should always get enough to turn around and buy a similar car without spending any of your own money.\n\nThey are going to give it to you in the end because if you refused their lowball offer and go to court, a judge is going to award you the cost to replace without any issue.  Court is expensive it is cheaper for them to just pay you the right amount up front.  They may still low ball you by 500 bucks, but at that point you take it to also avoid court.  I had a similar experience back in 03 when I was in a wreck that totaled out my mustang. \n\nThe first offer by his insurance was for $1000 and the he starts running the numbers by me. The first thing he had wrong was the mileage, he had it at 142k (it was an '89 mustang to fair) and the car only had 42k miles on it (thanks to grandma for parking it every winter.... )  Honest mistake so he has to go back and rerun numbers. Ended up coming back at me for $2000 I ended up turning him down. \n\nAbout a week after turning down the $2000, I got a call from my insurance company asking about the claim.  I told them the back and forth and how we weren't getting anywhere. My insurance company offered to run the numbers and offered $3000. I took it and ended up getting even more back from my deductible.  For anyone looking here, don't ever let an adjuster take a deduction for a branded/salvage title for any vehicle over 10 years of age.

You'll be stuck with the stupid payment for FAR, FAR longer than you'll enjoy the novelty of \"*look at how much money I have to spend right now!*\"\n\nIf you want to pay off your home faster, and you get paid once every two weeks, do this:\n\nDivide your mortgage payment in half and subtract that from every paycheck you get, right off the top. \n\nFor example, if your house payment is $1200, then every time you get paid, allocate $600 to your house payment.

For example, I get paid on February 3rd, and 17th (2 checks in that month) but in March, I get paid on the 3rd, 17th, and 31st.

It's a great way to make money, but if you get in the easy way (by using a HELOC to quickly buy a bunch of rentals when you have no experience being a landlord, for example) you're going to get wrecked. The HELOC is unrelated to how the homes in his example get paid off so quickly. It's a red herring. He uses examples of \"somebody with 3.5k a month net income\" not in the conventional sense of net income after taxes, but instead meaning leftover income after all expenses.

What if it soars higher in the months you're out of the market? Yes.\n\nIn order to make this strategy work you must time both your exit and re-entry point nearly perfectly. If the market continues to rise, you are missing out on gains. Even if you happened to call it perfectly on the way up, you then must be willing to buy in again on the way down. People who get nervous when prices are high don't tend to be the type who are also willing to be aggressive buyers in a slump. But your plan only works if you are willing to buy when everyone else is scared. Can you stomach that? If you time it wrong, even for 10 days, [you miss a lot of growth](http://www.businessinsider.com/cost-of-missing-10-best-days-in-sp-500-2015-3). The best days usually happen after the worst days. You'd have to predict both dates correctly to win the market timing gamble.\n\n Time in the market is almost universally more important than timing the market. \n\nI'll go look for that website with the timing the market game for you. \n\nhttps://qz.com/487013/this-game-will-show-you-just-how-foolish-it-is-to-sell-stocks-right-now/\n Why not reallocate into a more conservative fixed income portfolio instead of completely selling out of the market? Your money is eroding to inflation in a money-market fund. \n\nAlso, nobody can time the market, but if you aren't planning to retire soon it is fine to ride the waves out a bit. You're never going to achieve 100% efficiency.  You are not the first person who thought they could time the market.  You won't be the last.    \n\nThis is why I like dollar cost averaging.  You buy less shares when it's high, you buy more shares when it's low.  Eventually your highs even out your lows and you come up with a steady return.

Another post 'finding I am under payed' caught my attention since I am finding myself under a similar circumstance.  I am going to try not to go into many details for anonymity. \n\nI've been working for a company for the past 6 years.  There are 6 of us that work together in our department and share the same title, job description, expectations, etc.\nIt has come to my attention, one of my coworkers pointed it out, that our salaries are posted for anyone to see.  When I looked, I found that one of us is being payed nearly 40-50% more than the rest of us.  This is for the same job, he is not bringing a crazy amount of business than the rest of us or anything.  Working the same amount as the rest of us.  We are all around the same age, experience, time at the company, etc.\n\nHow do I use this knowledge to get myself a raise?  Salaries are public, albeit hard to find, knowledge.  How should I approach my boss? I am making good money now, and if I left I probably could get 5% more or so.  I can't help but feel there is money left on the table though.\n\nAny advice is welcome, I will try to fill in details that you need.\n\n ", "title": "Renegotiating salary after finding out coworkers salary?", "comments": "What others are earning is not necessarily what you are worth. If you are worth 5% at another job at another place that means that you are worth 5% more not 40%-50% more. \n\nYou can ask but this seems to be the opposite of you being underpaid but rather he is overpaid.  \"because Bob makes more than me\" might be one of the worst reasons so try and avoid it.\n\nYou need to highlight your own unique qualities and skills and ask for the raise on your own merit.  Actually this a good practice, but a misinformed taboo in our society. While most people are uncomfortable talking about salaries with one another it should actually be encouraged because it increases your bargain power with employeers. Under the National Labor Relations Act employeers can deny employees from discussing salary as it increases their bargaining power, state that you feel you could get 5 % more and why you are worth more or as much then your coworker are these salaries loaded or unloaded? Loaded salaries are used for billing government agencies and include company paid benefits. If a person has a large family and the company pays for family insurance then loaded salaries can be a bit deceiving. There are other reasons loaded salaries can show discrepancies. With a 40% differential there is almost no doubt they make more but they may not actually make 40% more so just be careful.  You can't.  If you could get 5% more on the open market, you can try to convince the bosses YOU and YOUR WORK is worth 5% more.  But pointing out that you know another worker is overpaid means nothing about whether you are fairly paid.\n\nIf you bring it up by referencing other people's salary, you establish yourself as a trouble-making difficult person.  Not a strong position to negotiate from. Just to play devil's advocate here for a second - it could be there is some legitimate reason (unknown to you) for why that coworker is making more.  That's the hard part with sharing salary information without the context of \"why\".  What peers see of each other does not always align with what managers see of their direct reports.\n\nA big differentiation that I sometimes see is communication skills. Maybe you think you and Joe (let's call him Joe) do about the same work, and bring in about the same amount of business -- but Joe is much better at communicating with his manager about what's going on, his challenges, and especially his successes. Meanwhile, you're working hard, head-down, and just reporting back to your manager whenever he/she asks.  Joe is going to be perceived as being more valuable, because the manager knows what's going on with him, and probably has a favorable impression of him, while you are seen as a hard worker, doesn't need much management, but otherwise you just kind of a black box.\n\nIt's also possible that employee negotiated a higher starting salary, and then got comparable percentage annual raises - so compounded over time he is making substantially more.\n\n Care to update?

My thinking is that if you had only a 10% down payment on a home then, yes, you have to pay PMI and with how the amortization tables are set up a hefty majority of your early payments go to interest as opposed to building equity but you have to have a roof over your head. It seems like you would be paying rent to the bank as opposed to the landlord but at least over time you would have *some* equity to show for you payments not matter how small which seems better then just paying rent to a landlord. \n\nI get that when you rent a landlord has to fix any major issues with the home instead of you paying for that out of pocket so there is also less liability involved with renting. \n\nIf you are renting a home that the rent is more or less the same as a mortgage payment (including PMI) would be for a similar sized home then why not take what you do have saved up, buy now (even though you do not have 20%) and build at least some equity as opposed to continuing to rent and trying to save until the 20% mark. You can even take what amount you were able to save past the rent before and throw it at the mortgage until you get to 20%. \n\nWhat am I missing? Is the PMI charges and less liability to fix major issues really worth renting and not building any equity until you have the right down payment?", "title": "Is the only negative effect of have <20% down payment on a home paying PMI?", "comments": "the downpayment is protection for you as much as the bank.  It means you have room before your underwater and unable to liquidate the house should you need to.\n\nWith that said, its a very real concer, and I try not to forget the recent lesson about treating the RE market as riskfree.  but this *is* the risk, other than that, if the RE market appreciates, owning a home is paramount, the ability to borrow such a huge amount of money into such a low risk investment AND deduct the interest?  Plus you get to live there....\n\nIf your salary is comfortable, if your job is stable, Id definitely buy a home even if your missing the 20%. You pretty much hit the nail on the head.  There's a higher chance of being underwater on the house especially in the first few years, but if you have at least 10% or so and you plan to stay in the house for 5 years or more, paying PMI and building equity is much more advantageous than paying rent for however many months or years it takes you to save up the rest of the 20%.\n\nEspecially if you live in an area where rent is higher than PITI payments on a mortgage, even including PMI, you will come out ahead. It will take only a small movement in real estate prices for you to end up owing more than the house is worth.  Then you will not be able to sell the house if you need to change jobs or have other changes in life circumstances. That doesn't mean that you definitely shouldn't buy with a small down payment but it is a real risk that you should be aware of. For a first house 20% can be hard to save up, especially in HCOL markets. We put 10% down on our first house (650k). Saving another 10% would have delayed the retirement contribution rate we wanted a lot, and housing prices are growing here in the 7-10% range so we would have been behind the market for a long long time. So, we accepted the PMI and are doing major remodels to increase the LTV to get the PMI off faster. I think we'll have it gone after 2 years instead of the 7 predicted by the lender. >why not take what you do have saved up, buy now (even though you do not have 20%) and build at least some equity as opposed to continuing to rent and trying to save until the 20% mark. \n\nRenting means you don't pay out-of-pocket when the furnace decides to die on a winter Friday night.  It means you don't have to worry about the roof damage after windstorm.  Those expenses fall on the homeowner.\n\nIts not a good idea to assume that rent payment and the equivalent dollar figure for a mortgage payment are equal in what you are getting for what you pay. I purchased my first home with an FHA loan and only put 3.5% down.  I do pay PMI each month.  It has worked out well.  The extra fee that was added to my payment (PMI) still allowed me to own a home, build equity, and have a monthly payment cheaper than rent.  One of the things I did to determine if it was worthwhile was to multiply the monthly PMI amount by the number of months required to pay it.  Is it better to own a home sooner than it is to save up the down payment while still paying rent?   Only you can decide which works better for you.  It was worth it for us to buy sooner.  We did buy a home at the lower end of our budget to ensure that we would not be \"house poor\" and we were able to add instant equity with just a few changes.  So far, so good!  You may also get a higher interest rate.\n\nYou may find yourself unable to sell if the market dips slightly and you not longer have any equity.  As withe verything, there is a \"skim\" involved with a house purchase, in fact its quite a large percentage these days ... its the difference between what the buyer pays and what the seller receives ... and inside of it is everything from home inspection fee to tax stamps to the real estate agent commission to the title insurance, yadda yadda ....\nWhat this means for everyone is that when you make a home purchase, you need to plan on being there for at least 5 years, so that the cost of the skim gets spread out enough to make it worthwhile.  If you move within, say, six months, the skim will kill you .... 10% down is very different from 3.5% or 0% down. If the mortgage is a reasonable expense for your budget and you have a solid emergency fund, 10% is fine even if it's not ideal. My local Bank ( Trustcobank.com ) allows 10% downpayment without PMI, so check different banks. [removed] I paid only 5% down, and I do have to pay some PMI. But you're right-- even though I pay alot in interests upfront, I get to deduct a large portion from my income tax (including that from property tax). In the end, the actual amount of interest I'm paying is much less than the rent I would have been paying on the same house.  I live in an area with pretty low cost of living and we specifically bought a house for less than we could afford. We put down 5%, pay extra, refinanced after a year to get rid of PMI and get a lower rate, and now have 30% of the loan paid off just over two years in. You're also assuming that you will have equity, which is not always the case. Depending on what report you read the number changes, but it was estimated the four million homes in the first quarter of 2016 were still in negative equity. FOUR MILLION! \n\nIt makes me queasy to see all the posts from inexperienced/first-time home buyers on PF that assume equity is a guarantee. Have you considered a 10-10-80 loan?  Basically you put 10% down, which gives you 10% equity.  Then you take out a HELOC on that equity giving you the other 10% needed for your 20% down.  So you end up with a regular mortgage plus a HELOC but no PMI.  Works best if you can focus on paying that HELOC down ASAP since the interest rate is higher than the mortgage. Entering into a mortgage is a major, very serious decision.  I think it is good to tread cautiously...whatever you do Generally, the higher the down payment the lower the interest rate.  For my bank, 40 and above percent obtained the best rate. These sites might help. I do think you might have a valid idea.\n\nhttp://www.realtor.com/mortgage/tools/rent-or-buy-calculator/\n\nhttp://www.mortgagecalculator.org/calculators/buy-vs-rent-calculator.php The lower the down payment, the more interest you'll pay over the life of the loan. A lot of this depends on where you live and your credit score. My husband and I live in an area where rent prices are really high (it's one of those 3 cities always cited on this sub...). Our credit scores are excellent and we are putting down 10% to leave us with a large e-fund and reno/furniture budget. The PMI? $90/month. To us, that is worth it. If the PMI was much greater, it may not be. if you cant out 20% down it means you cant afford the house\n\nit is a solid benchmark I read some good comments, here is my take on the matter. If you are looking at a 5 -10% down payment and you have decent to really good credit, it may be most beneficial to get two loans instead of PMI or lender paid MI. But it takes some savvy to get it right. Your first mortgage is for the 80% like you put 20% down. Then your second lien or piggy back is for either 10% or 15% depending on the size of your downpayment. Now in my experience with second lien companies, your probably looking at a 20 yr or 15 yr fixed as your best bet and with a crappy rate currently ~ 6-7%. First off avoid the balloon notes they often have, unless you really know what you are doing and why you want it. Mathematically this scenario will generally earn you equity faster than paying PMI with your cash flow the same monthly and should the RE market decline and you need to sell shortly after, you will be more likely to pay off your first mortgage if you sell. So you can get out easier if needed and mathematically as I've checked many times you earn equity faster than the alternative. Now its not a perfect situation, someone with all world credit scores is likely to have a low enough PMI rate that they wont earn equity faster with a 1st and 2nd lien and then a veteran on a VA or a USDA eligible property can well be better choices in those scenarios, but the math will lead you to the best choice. On a side note, with 2 loans you can always focus on paying the second one off first thereby lowering the effective interest rate on that loan and further improving your scenario vs PMI. It is also possible to have the RE market move against you and you need to sell asap and your underwater on your second mortgage only, and then you sell, and then a due on sale clause is triggered. But in that case, you would have the much larger monthly payment mortgage debt paid off, and you still have options in the event you do face a due on sale clause.\n 1. If there are any competing offers, buyers will often go with the higher down payment. This is because during close, your mortgage broker can hit you w/ a host of stipulations that will require you to either increase the amount borrowed, increase your down payment, or require larger capital reserves. If the borrower cannot afford to meet those additional requirements, s/he will have to withdraw their offer.    \n   \n2. Banks generally require you to have an additional 6 months of expenses in liquid capitol above the down payment and closing costs. If you struggle to achieve a 10% down payment, you may struggle hitting your capitol requirements, be forced to borrow more money, and end up with even less equity in the building.    \n   \n3. the more you borrow, the more you are leveraged, the bigger the impact housing fluctuations. Of course, I'm the black sheep here, and that's OK by me..\n\nHere's the deal.\n\nThere are many, many factors that YOU need to consider when making a house purchase.  Down Payment is one.\n\nHere are some questions for you to consider concerning your down payment.\n\nHow good of investor are you?\n\nDo you have 20% or more to put down?\n\nIs there room to increase the value of the house  in the short term(put in yard on a new house, remodel, finish basement etc.)\n\nAre you getting a \"screaming deal\" on the place in the first place?\n\netc etc etc.\n\nOnce you honestly answer those questions and others for yourself, then the answer should become obvious.\n\nMy \"rule of thumb\" is to put down THE LEAST AMOUNT POSSIBLE if that's 5%, great, if it's 3%, even better, if it's 0% better yet.\n\nBut, that's because I know the answers to the previous questions.\n\nAlso notice, I did not suggest that you try and predict the future.  Trying to determine the market trends, or the average rate of appreciation, or your job promotion prospects or anything like that.  Playing that game is a fools game.\n\nGood luck!!

If it's a family diamond I would definitely just keep it- I can't imagine your family being super thrilled if you sold it Keep it for the next potential proposal, honestly. You're going to have a tough time recovering close to that cost. expect a 40-80% loss... Keep it for your next gf and cut your losses! Do you really need 1500 that badly? Why would they not let you refund it exactly?  The resale market for wedding rings is very very poor.  I would expect that you will have to take a big loss on your $1500 where ever you sell it.  Getting the jeweler to take it back is probably where you would get the best price as they might want to keep your business for next time you might be in the market. You can probably sell for 25% of what you bought it for, assuming you got a fair price to begin with.  I went through the same thing, it sucks.\n\nAre you sentimental about the ring itself?  If not, just save it for the next time you propose.  Just do NOT tell the future woman it was originally for someone else...lol.  Engagement rings are a scam but most women expect one, so you have to deal with it. On a side note. Off of finance I hope you are OK. I also recently got out of a 3 year relationship and things are tough. I hope you're holding up ok! Speaking as a woman----don't use that ring again for another proposal. I know it's weird and shallow and--it's a thing. I mean rings aren't necessary for a good marriage anyway, they're about the sentiment and symbolism, and so it's just icky to get a ring chosen for another girl.\n\nTake the gems out and have it reset into something else if you propose again. You'll take a small loss that way but it would be much better than giving her the same ring. (And as someone who just got married and frequents wedding forums, you'd be amazed how many times this comes up that someone finds out she's getting a second-hand ring. Sometimes from the ex who is facebook stalking the current fiancee and feels like she has to out it as \"that was my ring haha\"--seriously awful). That or try to trade it in for something entirely different at a vintage/secondhand shop.  Another option is keeping it until you find the right woman and then trading it in for her ring. My fianc\u00e9 was engaged before me and he kept the ring until he traded it in for mine and got twice what they were offering in value if he wanted to sell it.  Unless you need the cash it might be more prudent to just hold onto the ring.

Are you adding to it?   \n\nAt $80K, you should be bringing in $4K a month.  You've listed $2600 in expenses.  At a minimum you should be putting $1500/month on your credit card. I've lived in NYC for 8 years. It's not the NYC cost of living that's making your salary feel like peanuts. $80k is a good salary for a single person even here. It's your debt.\n\nYour apartment is theoretically a good price for someone making 80k and may be a great deal. But I think that you have to think of yourself as actually making about 63k (salary less loan payments), and more like 55k if you want to make serious headway. And I think that $1,200 is probably too high on a 55k salary. If your place is objectively a great deal (and it may be), can you sublet it and rent a cheaper room somewhere? Your life will be much much less stressful if you're paying $700-900 in rent. You'd probably have to go pretty far out, but it doesn't have to be forever.\n\nI agree that it would help to know how your money is going out. I think it's easy for things like drinks out not to *feel* extravagant in NYC, because it feels everyone does it and it's a common way of socializing.

It feels terrible to be the one constantly saying, 'can we go somewhere cheaper', or stopping after one drink when everyone else is drinking on. \n\nI think that if you want to have a life, you have to consider yourself as  making a much lower salary than you do.

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* Okay, so let's say 80k salary nets you $4500 a month take home.\n\n$4500 - $1200 - $900 - $500 = $1900 remaining\n\nWhat are you doing with the other 2 grand bro? Food might take off another $200.... maybe some transportation expenses as well?\n\nSeems to me like you aren't actually \"penny pinching\" like you claim Are the loans federal or private?  If you have any that are federal, see if you qualify for an income based repayment plan.  Seems a little doubtful given your income but it depends on how much you have in federal loans.  \n\nMake sure you're directing any extra income at the debt with the highest interest rate.  \n\nOtherwise, the best advice I can give is to keep your eyes on the prize.  Like any eventual goal, break your goal of paying off debt into manageable pieces.  Use unbury.us to figure out when you'll get those pieces paid off.  \n\nI don't know the details of your debt, obviously, but your first goal might be along the lines of \"I have a credit card with a balance of $2000 and an APR of 24% that I want to get paid off.  The minimum payment is $40.\"  \n\nSo you plug those numbers into unbury.us [like so](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=40&name_0=Example%20Credit%20Card&balance_0=2000&payment_0=40&rate_0=24&).  \n\nThen figure out how much extra you can apply toward the debt.  If it's $100, change the payment in the Monthly Payment box by adding $100.  You'll get it paid off 5 years earlier and save $5600 in interest over paying just the minimum.  \n\nThat was my key to seeing a light at the end of the tunnel for debt repayment. > were you able to balance this debt along with having a semblance of a life? \n\nNo. I had no life. I was in a different situation, no debt but I was paying tuition without loans; there was just no room whatsoever for anything resembling a life. Figure out how you got into so much debt and how you plan on correcting your behaviors. You'll never be debt-free if you keep feeding your debt (aka, stop charging to CC if you can't pay it off every month).\n\n$80k is not peanuts. I've been there with $65k and was paying $1k+/month in loans (also in NYC). How you manage is you create a budget and factor in what is necessity vs \"fun\". Yes, living in NYC means you want to actually take advantage of living in a big city.. sorry to say this but, you can't afford that with that cc debt. \n\nMaybe after you knock out that debt, you can re-evaluate a small budget to \"fun\" things every couple weeks, but right now, all your money should be going towards your debt.\n\nGet a weekend job - even if it means $8-10/hour.

So if you were to take a 100k house and 100k in the market, over 10 or 20 years, the market will be worth way more than the house. \n\nAlso keep in mind when you buy a home, a huge amount of your money (especially early on) is going towards interest, taxes and insurance. \n\nSo while you're paying 1200 a month, only about 250 of that is probably going to go towards equity in the house. Meaning the other 950 is just gone in the same way rent is gone. \n\nWhereas if you were only spending 600 on rent, only 600 a month is gone and you could invest that other 600 into the market. \n\nIf your rent vs buy numbers were closer together, buying might win out, but if you can rent for half of the cost of buying, then renting might be the way to go. \n\nHowever, keep in mind there are non-cash benefits to a home versus say a small apartment. Such as more space, no landlord, no neighbors on the otherside of the wall (assuming traditional \"house\", not a condo or townhome). \n Do you have a downpayment and an emergency fund? Without those two you won't get a good deal on a house these days.  I think the age old advice applies here.\n\nMake sure you have six-months worth of money for all your monthly expenses.  So if you lost your job, do you have enough money to go for six-months without income?\n\nThe one bad thing about paying off a house, if you need money(and don't have a job at the time) it can be harder to get the equity out of your house.   Real estate is a highly local investment, so there is no blanket advice that works for everyone.  However smart real estate investing is one of the best ways lower-income people can build wealth. When you don't earn a lot, living costs are always high. Spending 50% of what you earn on rent, and socking away 6% of a low-wage salary ($1500 per year? Less?) will never get you financially secure no matter how long you work, save, and invest. Many end up looting their 401Ks by taking loans and withdrawals when an emergency arises, or they see gains simply stagnate due to high fees and poor performing investments.  \n\nReal estate has risks too, but homes will get paid off over time, provide a little tax shelter, and equity tends to rise over the long-term. For example a $100K condo that appreciates 8% in one year just profited you 8 grand for you doing exactly nothing beyond choosing to buy in a place with reliable demand. You can still go to work and save $ in a 401K on top of this totally passive investment gain.\n\nTo put this in perspective, I bought my first real estate more than a decade ago. Prices have steadily grown in my area, been flat at times (recession), and occasionally they jump. Last year was a jump year where the properties increased in value more than $100K, which is more than 100% of my salaried income over the same timeframe. I essentially gained a free year's worth of salary for doing nothing. Nice work if you can get it, right? My 401K by contrast, has never even come close to growing $100K in one year (not even remotely close), and I have been investing in the 401K for just as long, if not longer, than I've owned the real estate. I think my 401K grew a whopping $10K last year, and that was a \"better year\" than usual. It is the leverage you use to buy the real estate, and the large numbers involved, that makes real estate work.\n\nBuy real estate when you're as young as possible (I know, easier said than done!)  and if you're halfway smart about it, it can be the foundation for your future financial success.

During the application process of these things, I've always selected US Citizen when/if asked because that's what I thought I was, until like a year ago. I thought it was like the 18+ prompts where it doesn't matter what you put. Since then, I've tried a few other bank accounts, no cc, and still selected the US Citizenship option, knowing that I'm actually a resident alien with a green card, as are my parents because apparently I lack the brain cells to fathom how this could affect me and my family in the near future. FUCK.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI just googled to see if it did matter, read some stuff, and understand that I could get deported due to citizenship fraud? I get that deportation is bad and even though my friends joked about it all the time with themselves, there was never a reason for it to be of any concern to me. I am here legally, just didn't know that what I did constituted fraud. I also have an N-400, the application for naturalization in progress. The interview is scheduled for Feb. So, I'm freaking out right now and I've no idea what to do. I'm a first generation student currently in college going for a bachelor's degree in CS with a 4.0 college gpa, and being deported now would suck to say the least. From U.S. Code \u00a7 1227:\n>Any alien who falsely represents, or has falsely represented, himself to be a citizen of the United States for any purpose or benefit under this chapter (including section 1324a of this title) or any Federal or State law is deportable.\n\nWhat exactly constitutes a 'benefit'? Me choosing 'US Citizen' on those applications wasn't done to circumvent any regulations that choosing 'Resident Alien' on the CC or Bank applications would have otherwise. Also, I read something about an exception if I \"permanently resided in the U.S. (with a green card) before you turned 16\"? Which is true, yes, I've been in the US with a green card since I was ~5. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI've called my credit cards; Discover updated it in their system, and Capital One did as well. As for banks, I called Wells Fargo (checking account), and they transferred me to the relevant department and the CS said that I shouldn't worry about it, that the citizenship thing only really applies for credit related stuff. I couldn't get that in writing so I'm not sure what to think about that. I've called my other banks and the consensus is that updating the citizenship status can't be done over the phone and I'll have to go in branch to get that done. If a bank isn't local, I'll need to mail in a notarized request to have it changed.\n \n&nbsp;\n\nSo right now, I know that I need to get all my financial institutions to update it in their system. I'm posting this here because I don't know if that's good enough, or if there are other things I need to be aware of that I need to do? Is all this necessary? Does it even matter?

I tried to keep it short.\n\nFirstly, I filed my taxes with turbo tax this year. I am an Illinois resident working in Indiana. I don't own a home or rent in a technical sense. I give 100$ cash to my parents each month. Turbo tax said I didn't owe Illinois anything, but I did have to pay Indiana through their states website. Well in cook county, they get money out of you any way possible and I can't help but believe turbo tax is wrong. Who can I contact in regards to finding out if I don't owe Illinois money? The IRS, an Illinois state clerk? This is my first year filling taxes while working in Indiana. My past jobs were based in Illinois. \n\nAt one point turbo tax asked me about my financial history. Asking about if I opened a credit card in '15 with discover. Which I did. And if I was paying a mortgage that I had started back in '14, I said no. As I stated, I don't own a home. And have never co signed for a home. This made me very worried thinking I may have identity theft or some form of it.  \n\nI was told I could find out if I have a home in my name by getting a credit report. Such as freecreditreport.com. I have never done a credit check more then what my credit cards will say my score is. They say it is free and won't hurt my credit. But I'm very skeptical. I have also heard a credit report can be obtained once a year at a certain time. Would this week be acceptable? \n\nI'm sorry if these questions have been asked before. I just want to make sure I don't owe anyone money. \n\nEdit: I followed a link from the auto moderator for credit reports. Unusual information can occur on reports due to thin information on an individual and does not mean identity theft has occurred. I'm 24 so I would assume my credit history isn't big at all.

He has excellent financial fitness, maxes out retirement contributions, no debt, and enough money in mutual funds (not retirement) to put 20% down on the house purchase. \n\nI am not in a position to buy right now.  I have $28,000 in student loan debt and $6,000 in medical debt that I am trying to aggressively pay down.  Our original plan was to continue to rent for 2 more years until I would be able to be part of the loan.  For various reasons, we want to buy now.  \n\nThe plan is to have the loan in his name (he was just pre-approved for $350,000) and the title in both of our names.  What could be the downsides of this?  From what we have read, if we are both on the title, and a creditor comes after me, the house would be considered an asset and a lien could possibly be put on it.  I don't want my lack of financial health to negatively affect my partner at all.\n\nWe know that we will definitely talk to a real estate lawyer about a contract (what would amount to a pre-non-nup) that would outline what would happen if we were to separate.  We were planning on having both the loan and title in his name, with a contract that outlines what equity I would earn from paying X amount of dollars a month (a % of the equity based on how much principal my portion of the mortgage payments would be chipping away at).  We figured we could use a spreadsheet to keep track of it so that everything is transparent.  If this is still the best case scenario, we would do it.  However, if it is possible for me to get on the title (or a trust that included both of us to be created that would be on the title), we would both want to go that direction.\n\nWe are both first time home buyers.  We want to make the decision that would both protect and benefit both of us.  Any advice or insight would be appreciated.  We will still go to a real estate lawyer regardless, but wanted to be prepared as possible before the appointment.\n\nThanks!\n\nEDIT:  Thanks for the feedback!  I emailed him a link to this thread, and we will discuss tonight.  \n\nEDIT 2:  Definitely makes more sense to just make a contract concerning what I pay into the equity.  Not worth having my name on the title if it is going to make my partner financially vulnerable.  Thanks for the answers, I knew posting in this sub was a good idea...succinct feedback from individuals with no allegiance to either of us, which is what I wanted.

Questions about a loan in only his name and a title in both our names.", "comments": "If he was posting, we'd advise him not to do it, as there's no benefit to him in doing so.\n\nBut, from your perspective, there's no real downside, either.  As owner, you'd be liable for property taxes and any other fees on the house (e.g. HOA fees).  \n\nSome or even most lenders won't want to write the mortgage this way, with someone on the deed who doesn't pay the mortgage.  So the question may be moot, depending on your lenders.     This would be a bad situation for him, but not really for you.  If you two split up he'll still be on the hook for the mortgage, but you would still have ownership of the home.  This happened to me...ended having to do a  short-sale two years after buying the home (home appraised for less than the mortgage owed) and screwed up my credit for a few years.\n\nDo the right thing.  If you aren't going to be on the mortgage, do not insist to be on the deed. [deleted] Sir, If you're reading this link the only thing you should take away from this thread is that DO NOT PUT HER ON THE TITLE if she is NOT on the mortgage.   Honestly, if you guys are planning on getting married at some point, it probably makes more sense for him to have his name on everything and you pay him rent. Then once you get married everything will be joint. \n\nIf you aren't planning on getting married but still want to build equity in a house you aren't on the mortgage for, your SO needs to understand that he's getting a weird deal that could leave him in a bad situation. You can get lawyers to draw up all kinds of documents, but it would be a lot easier to just pay him rent and let him own the house for now.  I don't have any special insight or knowledge to offer, I just want to say GOOD FOR YOU for planning in advance how you would handle the house if you were to separate.  I don't see any point having your name on the deed.  He's buying it, not you.  Also, as long as you're not married, it's probably in your best interest to **not** be on the deed so that you aren't liable in any way if your relationship goes south. I was in a similar situation, and I also live in Wisconsin. The lender may be telling you that now, but it rarely is an option in the long run. A different option is to have a legal document drawn up showing that are an equal contributor/ partner in household expenses. Usually a lawyer will do this for a small fee. This won't give you rights to the house in the event of a breakup, but it would give you rights in the event of his death.  It seems like a complicated way to go about it, though advising anything otherwise likely entirely depends on both of your views on the relationship you have.\n\nAnd while your in the relationship it's hard for anyone to draw the line between where pragmatism should end and romanticism should begin.\n\nI think if you're both very pragmatic people then your solution works fine.  If not though, it's a very business like arrangement each month to have to follow and keep track of. For our home, the mortgage is in my name only.  Be only did it that way because the financing worked out better (we went through a first time buyers thing, and got a better option based on one income Vs two).  But he is on the title too. This is the arrangement my husband and I have, except he pays the mortgage exclusively.  I cover half of all the other expenses we incur. (I have student loans, he doesn't.  Also he makes more than me...)  The downside of this is: the house is his, in the incredibly unlikely event we have a falling out and get divorced.  It's there in our post-nup.  I lose.\n\nOn the *other* hand - everything that isn't the core house is mine.  I bought all the furniture.  I bought all the curtains, the linens - *everything.*  So again, in the incredibly unlikely event we split, everything that isn't nailed down is coming with me.  \n\nWe only have me on the title at all in case something happens to him, to avoid having the house go through probate court while I deal with everything else too.  (He jokes he bought me a house for Vday that year, since we were able to move in around that time.)   Not sure where you live but in PA it's a nightmare to try to get someone off the deed. My bf had no problem getting his ex off the mortgage but the deed required over a thousand dollars, signatures, notarized etc.  To the people worried about the guy in this situation:\n\nRelax, it seems like he's really smart, and obviously doing well because of it. I bet he'll also be smart enough to put the loan and deed solely in his name. \n\nAs for OP, very much consider being put on the mortgage. You're sharing part of the reward with none of the risk. I don't believe \n\n>we would *both* want to go that direction. Check with your tax professional. I would guess only he would be able to write off the interest on the loan.

Invest in a small start up if you want to have a say in another business. Some like kwaliteeinc.com seem to be looking to build communities and aren't going cost very much to have a say in the process.\nOr, take no more then $1000 and invest in a mix of stock and bonds. This will get your portfolio started and get you in track for retirement Expenses during young adulthood are very difficult to predict.  I would say the choice comes down to: Do you want to lock the money away for retirement with the expectation that you won't be touching it until you retire?  Or do you want to have the money available in case you need it in the near future for young adulthood expenses like college?\n\nIf it's the first choice, putting it in a Roth IRA is a great choice.  You won't pay taxes on it when it comes time to retire, and so it will have decades to grow.  Pick a target date retirement mutual fund or ETF that corresponds to the year you believe you'll retire (probably the furthest out available) and buy it and just leave it there.  You can contribute about $5500/yr to this IRA.\n\nIf it's the second choice, it gets a bit more tricky.  Since you don't know exactly when you'll want/need the money, it pays to keep it safe.  A government bond fund or a banking CD (certificate of deposit) would likely be the best choice in this case. Either choice will grow a bit faster than a traditional savings, with the former having the opportunity to go up or down in value depending on when you buy and sell.  The second won't go up or down in value, but will typically require that you lock in the money for a certain period of time, like at least a year.\n\nIn any case, Robinhood isn't bad if you want to try out stock trading, but yes, there is downside risk with stocks.  But there's also upside reward.  Stock prices really only matter at 2 distinct points in time: When you buy them and when you choose to or are forced to sell them (e.g. if they go bankrupt, which means you sold them for 0, or when they are acquired by another company.)  The rest of the time is just noise and if you believe in a company long-term, it's best to buy and hold, especially if you can collect dividends.  However, with the stock market currently at an all-time high, the risk is also at an all-time high... so you have to weigh that against the possible future of an economic downturn, after which is a much better and less risky time to buy stocks from whatever companies survive.

Each time I was quoted a different price anywhere from $80 to $140, with assurances that the quote they gave me would go through; that Regina or Tommi would call me back to confirm (never did); or to call them back myself at which point I was quoted a different price again to my frustration.\n\nI thought I reached the end of my ordeal when on December 27 on my sixth call I had my call escalated to another manager who repeatedly assured me that the contract I had negotiated with her this time would go through (50/50 internet, most of my regularly watched channels gone, no voice, all for $78.97/month for 12 months of a 2 year contract). She suggested that, to retain continuity, that I pay the full $364 bill and that she would issue a $173 credit on the next bill to cover for the fact that I never agreed to pay for the services given at the rate they were charging me. All that she did, she said would be processed on January 3rd.\n\nI acted in good faith and paid the $364 that was billed to me with the understanding I would be credited for the amount that was promised. Since you are reading this, you can guess what happened and my anger at being billed the original inflated price that I've been trying to change.\n\nI called customer service again, who told me the last order was still pending for some reason but that she could 'fix' this order and give me an even lower price. Now I fear that to get this resolved I will be once again told to be the fool and pay the full amount with the 'promise' to credit me again next month.\n\nWhat are my options in dealing with this? At this point I am thinking of cancelling my service, disputing last months charge with my credit card company, and refusing to pay the amount they billed me this month until at least they charge me the amount they agreed last time I talked to them ($78.97). If I refuse to pay this months bill after cancelling my service do I need to worry about them sending my account to collections and dinging my credit score? Or if I am cancelling, should I just suck it up, pay the inflated price and never look back at Frontier again?\n\n\n**TL;DR** Cable company is fucking me over with my cable/internet bill.

The response was amazing, I was cleared to spend a year in a long-term inpatient facility. I entered the program on November 11th, at which point I lost access to phone/internet. In September of 2015, I was allowed to speak with my Staff Sergeant and he let me know that a team had come to the unit and offered all Marines under the designation \"excess\" (I had been attached to this unit after my original unit had been disbanded and was essentially riding out my contract time along with 20 or so others from my old unit) to have their contracts end that day. Nearly everyone from my old unit took this option, and my unit also proceeded to do this for me, without my knowledge or consent. I'm not really sure how that happened honestly.\n\nApparently when this happened, our supply unit had to sign off on my separation, and as I was not there to turn in all of my issued gear, marked me as owing them for all of it. I was never informed of this by my Staff Sergeant and never received notification (as far as I know of) that I had an outstanding balance with my unit over the gear.\n\nFast forward to last Thursday, I come home to a letter from the U.S. Department of the Treasury, Bureau of the Fiscal Service with a notification I owe the U.S. Government $449.13. When I called to inquire about the debt all they could tell me was it was from the DoDDCM, Defense and Accounting Service.

We have perfectly fine credit, waited to buy a home because we wanted to pay off debt (wedding/student loans/auto/credit cards) first. Went from ~$45k in debt to ~$12k in debt over several years. Have an emergency and retirement fund but no savings for a down-payment. After research, discovered the county auction sells pre-forclosures and divorce settlement properties twice a month. I understand there is a lot of risk in buying a property like that (may need to be flipped or completely overhauled) but my question is specific to how do first-time bidders fund this activity?

The property is sold 'as is' and is subject to all liens and encumbrances.", "title": "How do I finance a home for sale on auction?", "comments": "Don't even contemplate this without working with a realtor who specializes in foreclosures and auctions. The \"subject to all liens\" part is what should worry you. You could actually end up purchasing an inexpensive home that others have a first-position lien on (in other words you don't really own it).  There are too many pitfalls and gotchas to explain here.  If you're not already a seasoned buyer you can't get up to speed fast enough on your first purchase -- you need an experienced representative.  \n\nMy advice is to forget about scoring a magical tax-sale deal -- everybody knows about this nowadays, and the deals simply aren't to be found that you imagine. Unless you live in the sticks, despite what the 10% bid verbiage states as the \"minimum,\" you will be bidding against people coming in with all-cash offers and you simply can't compete. The way financial real-estate \"gurus\" advise you to do this is to talk a private investor into fronting you all the cash (at 10% interest, on a 6-month term, mind you) and then working some fix-and-flip magic and a quick refi ... you don't want any part of that.\n\nAuctions get bid up to even beyond reasonable MLS listings these days, and you are further penalized by the \"as-is\" and \"no-inspection\" contingencies. Look, if you have no money for a downpayment, why would you buy a money pit? Those two things don't jive at all.  Stay renting until you have at least 10% for a downpayment. If you're desperate, there are first-time buyer progams and FHA loans that you can utilize with 3.5% downpayment if you must. I don't really advocate that, but I'd go with an FHA loan with PMI on a solid property before I went the county auction route.   You are correct:\n\n* it's not easy\n* one needs to have availability of funds pronto\n* one need to have expertise and experience in order to eyeball how much repairs etc a place needs without a thorough and professional inspection\n* one needs to understand the risk involved (this is mitigated by diversification in multiple deals)\n\nSo, just like most things in life, you'll be up against professionals. So the moment you outbid the pros, you know that you already either paid too much or took too much risk.  And then there's the issue of coming up with money.\n\nThe people who do this for a living, make a profit because they are compensated for all my points above. you should just get traditional for sale house, auction is not feasible unless you have 75-80% sale value in cash and can finance last 20% as home upgrade or unsecured loan. Auctions are tough it is usually cash or a no go.  The only real way to do this if you could somehow get a personal loan using other collateral other than the house ahead of time and use that.  I would not recommend that now if you want a good deal on a house that needs a lot of TLC I would recommend looking into foreclosures.  There are many foreclosures that the bank puts the house on the market for a few days takes all offers and looks at \"owner occupant\" offers first.  And if one of them meets the requirements they will take the best looking offer out of those.  You do take more risk with these sales as they are \"as-is\" sales.  Be prepared to spend a fair amount of money after you buy though because you will most likely need to replace anything the scrapers stole from the house along with what ever you need to obtain a certificate of occupancy if your area requires that.  The nice thing about the foreclosure process compared to pre-foreclosure is that the foreclosure process usually ends with a clean deed and shouldn't have to worry about the liens and encumbrances.  Good Luck! stay away from this stuff...big can of worms with foreclosed homes...tax repos...etc.... These auctions are not targeted at a first time homebuyer.  Or even a 2nd or 3rd time buyer.  They are for real estate investors who know what they're doing, not for someone trying to buy their first house.\n\n> but I can't get a traditional mortgage with 10 days can I? \n\nNo, which is why these auctions aren't for you.  They're for people who can write a cost_of_house sized check, without any lender requirements.  They're for people who can take the risk of buying a house without an inspection, who can risk all kinds of title issues, and most importantly, can handle a complete disaster of a purchase.\n\n> Advice for who to approach, or what to do next?\n\nForget about buying a house at government auction.  The farthest you should go into that world is finding a realtor that specializes short sales. (Note, you'll probably end up regretting this too, but a lot less than trying to buy at auction).\n\n Here's the deal.\n\nAuctions are a great way to buy houses undervalued BUT, you need to know what you're doing and the risks you are taking first.\n\nAs others have mentioned, pulling title is the first step.  Doing an inspection is another. There are more things, like SOMETIMES the reason the house is going into foreclosure is because there is something wrong w the house.  Landslide, shifting foundation, leaking in the basement, roof issues/ rotting, termites, etc etc etc.  So, you have to be aware that there are some unknowns to deal with and that's why you are getting a \"good deal\" on surface.  But, of course, once you get into it, you find all of these other issues etc.\n\nOutside of all of that, and assuming the house is nice, and well maintained, and the previous owner doesn't gut it (very common to pull the carpet, cabinets, fixtures, toilets, blinds, dishwasher, etc and sell them on Craigslist etc.)  \n\nAssuming it's nice and ready to move into to, here's how the financing works.\n\nIn my area you need $10k cash and the full amount w/in 24 hours.\n\nSo, what people do is they come to me (I lend hard money) and I do my research on the deal.  Once I do my research, I tell them how much I am willing to loan, and at what terms.  Then they need to come up w the remaining cash.  Once they have all of those numbers together, then they know what their max bid is on the property.\n\nAssuming they win the bid, then they pay the $10k on the courthouse steps.  Then they call me, I send my inspectors over, make sure there isn't anything glaringly wrong.  Then I wire over my portion and take title etc.\n\nThen the buyer then frantically tries to get long term financing (ie a traditional loan).  This typically takes 90-120 days.\n\nThen once they get their long term financing in place, then they re-finance me out and then they start paying their mortgage to the bank.\n\nSo, the only way that whole process really works is if you can get a \"screamin deal\" on the place, because my fees aren't cheap, and they have the \"risk money\" up front in case the place doesn't pass my walk through inspection, or it takes them longer to get LT financing etc.\n\nBut, this is the process and how it works.\n\nGood luck!! Without the required cash, you have pretty limited options.  One, you can borrow the money from a relative who has it.  Two, you can borrow money from a loan shark... er... private lender, if you have collateral they will accept.  The interest rate will be very high.  Three, you can walk into your bank and ask them how much they will loan you as an unsecured loan.  It probably won't be enough and they probably won't close fast enough. Four, you can borrow from your 401k, but you have to pay it back in a certain amount of time.  Five, you can take out a HELOC on your current home, but you are renting.  Six, you can find someone else to buy it and buy it from them.  My dad bid on an auction at the courthouse steps once and won.  Same rules.  He had the cash though.  It worked out for him, but he didn't really make a killing.  Didn't do it again. Most commenters here have covered it pretty well, if you want a more technical explanation you might want to cross-post on /r/realestate.\n\n\nThe short answer is, no. Don't do this. You don't finance a home for sale on auction, unless you have an open line of credit for significantly more than the purchase price of the house - or one of the FFF who is willing to lend you that much and can get it in a matter of days. \n\n\nAuctions are for experienced investors, not for first- or second-time homebuyers. You're best off looking elsewhere. You don't.\n\nAll foreclosure auctions are fee simple transactions afaik, meaning you show up with the cash (your own cash, no mortgage) or you walk away houseless.

The $18k limit is for pre-tax contributions, the limit for both pre-tax and after-tax contributions an employee and employer (or just the employee) can make is $54k.\n\nAsk your employer to find out what the max employer contribution is for 401k plans, they might surprise themselves.  IRS website:\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits\n\nIn this IRS site it talks about \"Deferral limits for 401(k) plans\" with the limit of \"$18,000 in 2015 - 2017\" and \"Treatment of excess deferrals\" with the limit of \"$54,000 ($60,000 including catch-up contributions) for 2017;  $53,000 ($59,000 including catch-up contributions) for 2016.\" I think that this is something that you will not find explicitly written in the IRS guidelines. This is what makes it somewhat of a sophisticated maneuver. \n\nIf you read the IRS guidelines [here](https://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-401k-and-profit-sharing-plan-contribution-limits) you'll see that the language is framed as such:\n\n>Two annual limits apply to contributions:\n>A limit on employee elective deferrals; and\n\n>An overall limit on contributions to a participant\u2019s plan account (including the total of all employer contributions, employee elective deferrals and any forfeiture allocations).\"\n\nThe IRS explicitly defines the limits of employee elective deferrals - this is the $18k limit we are all familiar with. However things are less clear how the total $54k limits are defined. My suspicion is that the entire 'mega-backdoor Roth' is based on a liberal reading of IRS guidelines. None of this is explicitly allowed, but rather is determined by interpreting those guidelines in a particular way; specifically with attention to what the guidelines *do not say*. This is exactly what makes it a 'loop-hole'. \n\nI would be happy to see a source defining this method explicitly, but from my reading of the IRS 401k guidelines, this is a very grey area. You can start with this notice from the IRS:\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/retirement-plans/plan-participant-employee/retirement-topics-contributions\n\nSpecifically under \"Types of employee contributions\"\n\nAfter-tax contributions are contributions from compensation (other than Roth contributions) that an employee must include in income on his or her tax return.

It can be surprising and scary, but not at all uncommon. \n\nWithout knowing what you said to your employer, we can't really say if they've answered your question properly.\n\n [These](https://www.irs.gov/uac/newsroom/irs-announces-2017-pension-plan-limitations-401k-contribution-limit-remains-unchanged-at-18000-for-2017) are the limits that you'll want to look at when discussing your 401(k). Not really sure why limits are even being mentioned if your only question is to have Roth as an available option.\n\nYour adoption agreement probably prohibits a Roth option. Voya is most often bundled, so instead of searching around for a TPA you may be able to go directly to Voya. You'll have to check with your Plan Admin. It is a DOL/ERISA requirement that plans be in the best interest of the participants, if participants specifically request a Roth option they have a fiduciary responsibility to make that available. They will pay amendment fees and various other charges. \n\nUse this, it's indisputably an option made available to them. \nhttps://www.voya.com/products/401k-plans\n\n>Roth accounts: May also be offered by a plan sponsor under 401k, 403b, or governmental 457b plans.

You know how that works out, we broke up and she left. With the car.\n\n\nAs of right now, I am getting rides from my family everywhere I need to go and it's getting so inconvenient.\n\nI could *technically* save money for a vehicle. After all my bills, I have around $400~ to spend/save but the main problem is that it would take me a good couple months to save up enough for a decent car that won't break down on me. I am in the process of lowering my monthly bills so my spend/save amount will raise eventually.\n\nEven after paying off all my debt(3 debts paid) my credit score stands at a little over 500 so going to a \"legit\" dealership is out of the question.\n\nI need a vehicle, yesterday. It's been 2 months and it's bothering not only me, but my family as I live out of the way.\n\nIf I could get a $250 car payment per month, that would be perfect. I just want something nice that won't break down, and that will last me a long while.\n\nIs this a viable option?", "title": "Has anyone here had a GOOD or neutral experience with a buy-here pay-here dealership?", "comments": "Start small and save for whatever you can get. Get a car off craigslist that'll last you a few months. Sell it off for about 80% of what you bought it. Use the money saved up in the few months of driving it, to \"upgrade\" to something that'll last you more than a few months. Rinse and repeat, until you have a car that suits your needs. This way, your car is always paid in full, depreciates only a little bit (hundreds a year instead of thousands), and is like making car payments. Only hiccup is that you have to drive a beater in the meantime. You could even potentially get something really nice and new if you stick to this for a few years. Instead of flipping every few months, flip every year, and eventually you could have 10,000 EZ-PZ\n\neg:\n\n250/month = $500 car in 2 months. (or get a family loan for $500) Sell that car after 2 months and you should now have $900. Save that for 6 months and sell. You now have $2200. This car can last you a few years if you take care of it. You've had a car for 8 months and you have a paid off car that'll last you a few years. Grats, you just bought mad time for planning your next step without getting into debt. Reliability? Just buy a toyota corolla or honda civic.\n\nIn 2 years, you could easily get a $4.5k car which is pretty much the \"used sweet spot\" her on r/PF. If you keep it up, in 4 years you could have $8.5k if you upgrade every year. That's a nice used BMW or whatever you want. \n\nPaid in full. Manageable payments. Upgrading. I was in the same spot you were in a couple years ago. It wasn't the *best* decision I ever made but if you can make the monthly payments and you are okay knowing you are paying a high interest rate plus over market value, everything should work out.\n\nSome points you should know before going to a dealership like this;\n\n* They will give you a vehicle if you can make the down payment. This does not make you special. They do this to almost everybody. I've personally known unemployed people with TERRIBLE credit reports get cars just for paying the down payment on tax time. We call these dealerships \"drug dealer lots\" because they often don't care about anything other than the down payment. I will explain in my next point why.\n\n* They are ruthless with repos. I am talking, you cannot be a day late on your payment or say goodbye to your car and down payment. They do this because time is money. They expect to repo almost every single car they finance. They aren't going to sit here and work things out with you on the payment. They will just take the car and down payment and finance it to someone else. Starting the circle over again.\n\n* Be smart. Ask about the interest rate. Ask what the monthly payment is. Ask about the warranty and how often the deny claims. They accept the lowest class of people who are usually just in a rush to get a car and are just excited for a vehicle. It's still a very smart idea to ask a lot of questions.\n\n* Stick to the mindset of short term financing. If you have a choice between a 14K car and a 5K car, for the same monthly price, get the 5K car. You'll be paying for YEARS less.\n\n I bought a 2001 Monte Carlo from one of those, paid $125 a month for a year. (I had other money I put down, I think the car was $3000). No issues, and the one time I had to pay late, I called them and they gave me an extra two weeks. It was all cash, so no interest was on the remainder I owed. But, at least with the one I used, you don't accrue credit. You have $400 leftover a month, think about the actual cost of owning a car.\n\n$250 car payment (150 left)\n$100 insurance (50 left)\n \nJust your car payment and insurance and you only have $50 left over, if you live around 15 miles away from your work then you're going to be spending around $150 a month on gas. \n\nSo with car payment, insurance and gas you're already at -$100 a month. You can't afford to do that. You would need to get a cheaper car and even then, oil changes, brakes, registration, change of title all of that cost money.  There are no upsides to paying predatory interest rates. Don't look at monthly payment. You're about to willingly bury yourself. Plus, a financed car requires full insurance, which will eat up what little money you have left. All you're going to do is end up either paying $14,000 for a $6,000 car, or end up paying $3,000-$6,000 to \"borrow\" the car until it gets repo'ed when you fall behind.

She has one bank account currently, but it is really in her ex-fiance's name with her as an authorized user. They opened it while they were still together. Now that they've broken up, she doesn't want him to have access to her money (he hasn't tried to take any money so far, but he might, and he does check the account to harass her on her spending so she normally just pulls out her money after it is deposited and functions in cash as much as possible), but she cannot open an account on her own. \n\nWhat are her options in terms of checking accounts? Is something like the Amex Serve prepaid debit card thing a good choice? Location is Chicago suburbs/Northwest Indiana area (right on the border on the Illinois side).\n\nEdit: She has poor credit, but she is also likely in the Checksystems \"system\" as, well, not good standing.

This might be helpful: http://twocents.lifehacker.com/how-can-i-open-a-bank-account-when-my-credit-sucks-1585417920 Credit usually doesn't impact your ability to open a checking account.  Being on Chexsystems does.  If you overdraw a checking account that is then closed by the bank while overdrawn, or if you are flagged for fraud, your information gets put into Chexsystems.  This makes you a high risk to banks, and nearly all will not open an account with you until you resolve with whatever bank flagged you. That needs to be her first step.  \n\nThere are some banks (Fifth Third, for example) that might open a type of hybrid account that will allow her to continue to operate with cash, but she can get a debit card and also acquire money orders, cashiers checks, etc., as needed.  It's called Express Banking with Fifth Third.  That being said, depending on why she's flagged, even those accounts can be hard to open.   I am sort of in the same situation and I recently opened an account with Chime and have really liked it so far. They don't charge fees and they don't let you overdraw the account, so I think they are more forgiving than an average bank. It's an online bank, though, so there are some drawbacks, but better than the fees associated with something like the AmEx Serve accounts.  People like her are pretty much whom prepaid cards are made for. The Amex Serve is good.\n\nBUT, there are also banks who with accounts specifically for people in her shoes. They may have fees or be more restrictive, but it is temporary and could be a good bridge - many offer to convert to a regular checking account after about a year in good standing.\n\nTry googling \"Second Chance bank account\".\n\nThis seems like a good article [Second Chance Checking Accounts Across the U.S.](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/banking/second-chance-checking/) with information about how they work and a list of national and Illinois banks.

I have 7 accounts with them and they demanded $50 minimum per account resulting in a grand total of $350 per month, which at the time I could simply not afford. The rep I spoke to that day said that even if I were to pay less than the $350 per month they were still going to report to the credit agencies that I was delinquent on my loans.

If you genuinely couldn't afford them, why didn't you just put them into forbearance? You would have still accumulated interest but wouldn't have been reported delinquent. Also if you go directly through fedloan, most of the time they have plans where you can pay as much as you can. This is why I hate how many schools do financials, because they train their financial aid officers to help people as young as 17 take out massive loans but not to educate you about the important things like subsidized vs unsubsidized loans, what to do when you can't pay your loans, how fast interest compounds, etc. Anyway I wouldn't exactly say you're in a \"good financial position\". Having money because you ignore your debt isn't a financial strategy, as you've learned. How is your credit score? Student loans do a doozy. I ignored mine for a year when I was 18 and didn't know what to do and I've been paying $100-300/month ever since but my credit score still suffered from that one year. Do you have credit cards or anything else that may balance it out? Even if you could pay all of your student loans in full right now, it wouldn't immediately erase all the missed payments on your credit report. Sucky situation for sure. Whatever you do, don't go with the only home loan that will accept you with bad credit. Usually these are structured badly and you'll end up a slave to even more debt. Your best bet would be to rent for now while you build your credit score, making steady payments chipping at your student loans, try getting a secured CC if you aren't eligible for a regular credit card, get things in your name that you know you'll always be on top of ie phone payments.

Anything over $1000 in my savings I use to make large payments towards my credit cards. This method works well for me and I've been able to pay about $650 a month towards debt.\n\nI also put about $1000 into a flex account each month. This pays for all things not covered above.

Paying all $5000 towards my auto loan and refinancing $13k over 3 years at 1.99% with my credit union\n2. Selling my car for $15k, using $3000 from my refund to pay off the loan. Then buying an $8k car, financing over 2 years @ 1.99% paying $320 a month. Using the remaining $2000 to put another dent in my credit cards.\n3. Using all $5000 to nearly eliminate my cc debt. Finish them off in a few months, then take the money I was putting towards ccs and pay down car loan quickly.\n\nNo matter what I will continue taking that additional money each month and apply it towards debt. My boyfriend is moving in with me in 5 months and that will cut my expenses down quite dramatically.

In your case, it may make sense to pay off the CC since it will probably trigger over to the highest interest rate of all your loans when the zero interest period ends. \n\nAfter that I would target the highest interest rates first (like that 9% loan) while making the minimum payments on the others.  Once that is done, move on to the next highest interest rate and target that loan.  \n\nWith regards to selling/refinancing the car, you are going to take a guaranteed $3,000 hit when you sell it to save a little on interest by buying a cheaper car.  I would hold on to the car.  I have not done the math on it, but I do not think it will make a big difference in your overall financial outlook.   \n\n $1000 for an emergency fund isn't much of an emergency fund when your expenses are $3000/month.  However, with your level of debt, I understand why you've made that choice.  I made the same choice for years as well, though the usual guideline on emergency funds is 3-6 months of expenses.  \n\nIf your CU will let you do #1, that's a solid plan with a decent return.  What I'd do if you go with this plan is to do that, then pay off the CC's at an accelerated rate, then pay off the private student loans next.  If it's at 1.9%, the car loan isn't a big interest sink.  If you're able to do #1 with even less than $5000, even better... throw that at the CC's.  I'm betting the APR on the credit cards is going to be huge after the 0% period. *breathes in* ...boi. Alright let's go step by step here. First of all I whole-heartily disagree with downgrading the car, you are about 3k underwater on that puppy so just cut your loses and drive that bad boy into the ground until it breaks. Next time buy a cheaper car but count this as a lesson learned. \n\nNext, refinance your private loans but *don't* extend the term, just get the interest rate reduced. This will save you a ton of money in the long term. As for the government loans, is it possible to work in the public sector to qualify for PSLF? You didn't list your field of work but I'm hoping this might be an option, 30K less in debt would be a massive burden relief. \n\nCut cable and switch to Netflix only. Trust me on this, I did it and I've never been happier. A $1000 a month \"fun money\" budget is *way* too high. Bring that down to about $500, max. Cook your own food instead of eating out, that's probably the worst thing you are blowing money on. \n\nPay off your debt in order of highest interest first. Calculate how much per month you need to be paying on that credit card to take *full* advantage of the 0% interest rate, quick napkin math says that will be about $600 a month. \n\nBest of luck! As a word of caution: Be sure to sort out your allowances on your W4 correctly for next year. Your return may look quite different after a full year of income.  > Private Student Loans - $342 (soon to be refinanced over a longer term)\n\nWhy are you going to refinance for a longer term thereby giving them more interest?  Paying off your student loans asap will give you a 5-9% ROI immediately vs a 2% ROI on your car.  So stick with your car (for better or worse, you already bought it), pay off your student loans, and save money.  Your first 1-2+ years out of college be in super frugal mode to get your finances in order.\n\nAlso, as much as this may sound mean, dont plan on the BF paying off anything (great if he does, sucks if he doesnt, Im not questioning your relationship).  Worry about making YOU self sufficient and solvent in case anything goes wrong--e.g. lost job, will BF be able to carry your financial burden for up to 3 months (and even if he could, would you want him to?). >Paying all $5000 towards my auto loan and refinancing $13k over 3 years at 1.99% with my credit union\n\nJesus Christ, no, please don't.  No.  Your private student loans' interest rate is 5-9%! PAY THOSE OFF FIRST!  Always go highest interest rate first, always, always, always.\n\nThat's if you think the CC's absolutely will be paid off before the year is out.  If not, pay them first, unfortunately.\n\nJust please don't focus on your car loans. 2% interest is NOTHING.  It's barely above inflation.  If you can get it refinanced to 1.99% (which I fucking doubt, honestly, because your debts so far outweigh your income) then don't bother with it.  Even if you can't it's still lower than 5-9%.\n\nSide notes:\n\n-What the Hell are you doing financing an 18k+ car on 68k salary when you have 60k in debt?\n\n-What the Hell are you doing with 7.2k in CC debt?\n\n-Try to refinance those 5-9% private loans, Jesus Christ.\n\n-Ditch cable.\n\n-A thousand dollars a month for Gas, groceries, then the rest are just a bunch of luxuries you list that you can't afford.  Stop budgeting for your excesses, please.  Put another couple hundred of that towards your massive debt. $650/month is right about on target to finish off the CCs before the end of the year, and before you incur any interest (which I assume is your plan). I would keep doing what you're doing on that front, you need to stay disciplined so you don't end up paying tons of interest (not sure what the rules are on your cards, but I know for some you can end up owing *all* the interest that would've accumulated if you don't pay it off before the promotion ends). If there's any chance that you circumstances will change and you won't be able to make that 650/month payment, I would consider putting some of your refund into the CCs.\n\nI see the appeal of refinancing the car loan, but that doesn't look like your most urgent debt to me. Your private student loans are at twice the interest rate of your car loan. I know you say you're refinancing them soon, but you don't say what the rate will be after that. You might be better served paying them down a little, depending on what the rate ends up at. \n\nAs a secondary note...maybe re-evaluate your 1k un-budgeted flex spending that's even higher some months (you mentioned you've only been doing ok at sticking to your limits). You could do a lot for your almost 80k of debt if you cut down a little there. Eliminating 10k of debt in a year is great work, but given your salary, I think you could do more. Remember, the more you pay down now, the more you save long term and you'll ultimately have more money to play with and less debt to stress you out. Also that internet/cable bill seems crazy high! I would see if you can lower that and throw the difference into your savings every month to up your e-fund a little. Damn I don't understand how people have such huge returns if not married w/ kids. You're not in the worst boat because you make a decent amount, but you need to cut out eating out, coffee and other luxuries. You don't have room for that until your stuff is paid off. Start reading about getting your finances in order and ditch cable too. Refinance those horrid private student loans.. That will keep you awake at night for years. Use your refund to pay down your credit cards and pay them off before your time is up for 0%. The car is the tough one. That rate is too high too, but you may not qualify to refinance that low. You might just have to eat that one. Getting a worse car that you'll have to repair instead will not benefit your either.  Don't let your credit card debt stay on for longer than the interest free period. Pay it in full, or you will owe interest on everything retroactively. If you have the discipline and luck to do so, you can pay off the CCs before you every have to pay interest on the debt.  The biggest thing you can do to reduce your debt would be to sell your car and buy a cheaper one.  I think you should do option two.  \n  \nTake the money you save on the car each month and add it to your credit card payments, to make absolutely sure those are fully paid off before you have to pay any interest on them.  \n  \nIf you get in a bind, note that you may be able to get a small unsecured loan from your credit union.  That might be enough to pay off the credit cards near the end of the 0% grace period, letting you avoid the likely 20% rate you'll get charged on what's left.  \n  \nAlso, maybe grow a beard?  An electric trimmer is like $20 once and then you really only need 1-2 razors a year for touch up.  Seriously - there's probably stuff in your $1000 flex account you could cut as well.  Going out, eating out, coffee are fun, but optional, and all the more rewarding when you get them back because you've paid off your credit cards in full. you are getting a nice REFUND (currency) having submitted your tax RETURN (a paper form). please learn the difference.

Either you had deductions you didn't account for on your W-4, or your employer didn't withhold correctly. You should have gotten almost nothing back (+/- $100 or so, maybe a few hundred if your salary changed during the year). For example, assuming $74,000, no 401k/health care deductions, and bi-weekly pay, you should have had $449 withheld per paycheck for Fed income, so $11,683 total. Taxes on $74,000, minus std deduction and one personal exemption (not a dependent) is $11,684. This, you'd owe $1.\n\nGetting married certainly changes things, so going to the Married with higher single rate is very likely okay if that's what the calculator says. Since your previous setting was wrong, don't worry about how it compares to your old setting. Besides, remember the lower earner should put 0 allowances on their W-4 (see note in the upper right of the W-4), so that also affects your allowances.\n\nAnd yeah, you can put whatever number you want, within reason. Don't put in 10 or anything. The IRS does want you with pay the appropriate taxes as you earn money, and not pay all at the end.

Distrust in the markets? Mortgage, for sure. Compare the $120k that you owe, compared to your monthly payment multiplied by the number of months that you have left. Take whatever tax deduction you got last year, and multiply it times the number of years left. This will give you a \"good enough for government work\" calculation on how much you're really paying for that $120,000. It will surprise you, and at 4.25% you could pay off the house.\n\nCompare that to your truck monthly payment times the number of months left. Compare that to your current balance. I know that you aren't interested in hearing conflicting opinions, but at my 1.9% interest rate on a $12,000 car balance with 3.5 years left, I'm looking at paying about $450 in 3.5 years on it, so if I were going to either choose between paying it off or spending it on a party, I'd pay it off, but at that interest rate you REALLY might reconsider just letting it ride. You could fully fund your Roth IRA for 2016 and 2017 this week if you wanted, and do better than that, even over just 3 years. Or, live off of that $20,000 remaining savings, and put 100% income towards your 401k, HSA, etc. Again, I understand that you explicitly stated one option or the other, but the reality is that you came in here saying \"My house is on fire. Should I put on my red shirt or my blue shirt to hide the smoke damage best? Please note that I don't want any advice about putting out the fire, as I don't care to do so at this time.\" I wouldn't recommend draining your savings to pay off your debt. You do, however, have a few options. You could ay a significant amount of principal down on your house and build additional equity (which also might cause a re-calculation of your payment), you could also pay a portion against the house and pay the truck off and then start applying your truck payment directly against principal on the house, or back into savings. There are other scenarios, however paying down (or off if that's what you truly want) the house will save you the most money long term as you're paying the most interest there compared to the truck. If the $140k is the entire sum of your savings, that's probably a bad idea. You want something to fall back on if things go south.\n\nIt's probably safe to knock out a healthy chunk of the mortgage though. Personally, I would pay off the house and $10k of the truck. Then use the amount that would otherwise have been going towards the mortgage to finish off the truck in a few months.\n\nThat's not mathematically optimal; the truck loan is only 1.75%, but if you don't want to do any investing, it's the way to go. I'd pay off the house. Then pay extra on the car until it's paid off(use the money you would use to make your home payments normally which would pay your truck of in about 2 years)or if you want to build savings up just put $300 extra to the car and the rest goes to savings and you will still pay the car off early.This would be the best way to go to save the most interest.  house.... then use the mortage payment towards the truck.\n\nnothing better than being debt free!! If you're limited to paying off those two investments... Go with paying off the house since it has a higher interest rate.  I would pay 100k towards the house. This leaves you with a healthy emergency fund and at the same time keeps your mortgage active so it can handle property tax and insurance. I don't think this was brought up yet, but if you consider the fact that you're paying a higher rate on your insurance because the truck is financed, your effective interest rate on this truck might actually exceed or get close to the 4.25% on your mortgage.\n\nDepending on the specific circumstances, and ONLY if you consider yourself to be an extremely conservative driver. I would consider paying the truck off entirely, dropping the excessive coverage required by your insurance company, and using the remainder to pay down the mortgage and maintain a decent emergency fund. highest interest rate first (HIRF) method. or volatile interest minimization (VoMIt) method. Either, it doesn't really matter. Each option has a set of benefits. \n\n**Car First**\n\nIt's a lower dollar amount, it's more prone to risk, it depreciates faster.\n\n**Home First**\n\nIt's a higher rate, you'll get a better return, it's a higher monthly payment\n\nNo matter what, keep 3-6 months worth of expenses in savings as an emergency fund.  Pay off the house, however as soon as you do establish a home equity line of credit.\n\nThat way if something major happens like a job loss you have a line of credit you could potentially draw down. While the interest rate  on a HELOC is likely to be higher(and usually variable)  compared to your 4.25% mortgage rate the hope is you would never use it; plus if you did need to use it ideally you would only be withdrawing and thus paying interest on the portion of would need. Borrowing 10k-20k-30k at ~6% interest is still far better than paying 4.25% interest on 120k that you are currently.\n\nYou could end up in a situation with $20k in savings, a fully paid off house with a 80k HELOC setup for a ~10 years draw down at a prime + 1.5-2% variable interest rate for additional emergency funds, and 23k owed on your truck at 1.75%. What is the current value of the truck? If you are upside down I'd pay that off first.\n\nI would also hesitate to use all your cash to pay off the house. Make a large payment on the principle but reserve cash for emergencies. I try to think about these questions in terms of what I'd do if I were in your shoes, but that's hard to do without knowing your income. So in general: \n\n1. Set aside 6 months of expenses. \n2. Pay off the truck. \n3. Dump any remaining money into the house. \n4. From this point on, pay at least an extra $325 of principal on the mortgage and knock it out as quickly as possible. you don't have to pay off the entire balance on either one...allocate a chunk...and then make extra principle only payments....NEVER make yourself cash poor Not enough info provided to give solid advice. What other investments do you have, what is your job security, age, and annual income? Pay off the car and continue to pay the mortgage as you have been.  getting down to only one debt will be good and the house interest in tax deductible (if you itemize) plus keep money in the bank is good if things go south.

Vanguard also said there would be essentially no fees. Unfortunately, I didn't read the full [fee schedule](https://investor.vanguard.com/investing/trading-fees-commissions), nor did I understand that 18 of the funds funds I was in with WFA would qualify for the $35 transaction fee Vanguard charges to sell non-Vanguard funds. $35 doesn't seem like much until you have to multiply by 18...

Is it difficult for a company to switch retirement providers?"}{"body": "Previous life choices left me with a ~620 FICO score and a dud of a car that I owed $4000 on. So I traded the car in, got $1000 credit for it and rolled the rest into a car loan for a $12k car.\n\nFast forward to now, I still owe $14k on a car worth $10k and depreciating fast. 8.5% interest and on a repayment plan set to finish in Oct 2023. Everything else in my life has improved. I got a REALLY awesome job making some serious cash maxing my 401k with a generous employer match, I bought a condo right when interest rates were at their lowest and paid off most of my other debt except for $16k 3.5% student loans which I don't feel bad paying monthly for, and my wife's car which she got a great deal on and only have under a year's worth of ~$120/mo on. Wife and I have 700 and 730 credit scores now. (Maybe worth mentioning my wife has student loans too, same rate, but she works in public service; we expect those to be partially forgiven so we chose the extended graduated repayment plan. Per month payment is ridiculously low it doesn't make much of a dent in our finances as a whole)\n\nSo it seems the car is the next challenge to tackle. Given everything, I can afford to double my car's payments (from ~$250 to ~$500). If I can get the loan down to 115% (might be able to do this in one shot with tax refunds) of the cars value then I can refinance it to get a much better rate. Would the refi be worth any associated costs, or should I continue increasing the payments until it's paid off? I could potentially increase payments to $750/month as soon as a year from now. I am thinking I'd rather start contributing to an IRA than making extra car payments though. As it is I know I have enough to retire by 59 so not too worried about IRA.\n\nEdit: by super rough calculations, I think refinancing could save me like $500 in interest.\n\nEdit2: another note: paying some amount in mortgage insurance (I think $190/mo but I don't remember) -- would it be more worth the monetary effirt to try to get enough equity to drop that? Or am I right that my car is my next priority? Rapidly increasing home prices here might rage care of that for me soon, or at least that was the assumption I made when I choose to buy a condo without a good down payment. 3 months ago when we closed we were at 97% loan to value. I (conservatively) expect value to go up 10% in next year (similar homes in the area went up 16% last year, still lots of growth and development)", "title": "Worth refinancing car?", "comments": "It's a simple math problem. Add up the amount you'd pay in interest, using a loan calculator like on Bankrate. If the amount of interest is higher than it would cost to refinance, then yes, refinancing is worthwhile. Between car loan and PMI, they're probably equally worth paying off.\n\nYour math is way way way incorrect. A $14,000 loan, at 8.5% APR, that won't be done until 2023, which means you have at least 70 months of payments remaining, if not more, is more like $4,000 in interest if you ride it out normally starting from today, not even counting the interest that you've already paid. It's probably worth paying against it pretty fast, and refinancing, as long as the amount of time that you're refinancing has you finishing earlier than 2023; don't extend the term out. That's a fire that you want to put out, to put thousands of dollars back in your pocket.\n\nAnd then, yes, once the auto loan is under control, you want to get rid of the PMI on your condo. You're throwing away $2,300 a year, so any savings that you thought you were getting from a lower interest rate is far far away more than offset by getting hammered with that. Throw money as hard as possible to get out from under that; don't just expect the market to swoop and and save you via double-digit growth. It's just as likely that you're in a bubble and the value tanks. Have you considered refinancing your wife's car and applying the cash to your car? Assuming her car is worth equal or more than yours, that would give you a better shot at a lower rate and let you refinance earlier (saving interest payments). Or at least drop the amount you have to refinance on yours low enough to get a better rate. \n\nI would definitely run the numbers and see if it makes sense, but it might be worth considering since you're underwater on the car and unlikely to get a decent rate.

More stuff? More security? Knowing you can retire early? Does this mindset make you happy? If it does, then there's nothing wrong. The problem is if money is your goal, there will always be some one higher than you. Which in turn, will always leave you empty.\n\nNow I'm not saying money is bad or not to work hard to get it, but you have to figure out what that \"more\" is in your life. \n\nSet goals apart from strictly salary numbers such as: I want to travel here, I want to save X amount, I want a house, I want to retire at this age.\n\nThese goals need money but are actually able to be measured by not comparing your salary to others. That way you can work towards something that you can achieve without ultimately feeling empty chasing dollar signs on your pay check. I can relate to this a bit. For me, part of it came from knowing that there were people who did less than me, or who weren't as good as me, who I knew were making a lot more than me. \"$80k - great! But John is probably making more than $120k so I need to get there.\"\n\nThe adage about money not buying happiness is true, but it allows you to be happy. Want to try a new hobby -- money allows that. Money = comfort and while you make modest gains with a middle-class salary you're going to get more comfortable. Obviously this curve smooths out -- going from $10 million to $15 might not give you the \"happiness\" gains that going from $100k to $150k might.\n\nDon't fret it -- keep working hard - don't let work or money be the only thing that matters. It's pretty simple. [deleted] Made my first 100k at 25. It's never enough. It's not a problem. Keep reaching higher.  Hey, I was like you, and at times I still feel the way you do. What helped me was looking at the people around me that do more with less, looking at other personal finance and critically look at what they are doing and mimicing it to an extent. I make roughly 70k @ 27, it's high for some people, low for others, but I own a house, buying a new car, have money in investments and still have $600 a month to buy food, and have a good time. I think it's about perspective and instead of trying to live like the jones's or being jealous that Joe Blow beside you does less and gets paid more.\n\nI will say though that more money definitely help achieve your goals faster, but I think setting a realistic goal is the most important step along with living within your means. I'm one year older than you with the same salary. Was 1st gen when I went through college but now both parents have degrees as well (yay!). I get similar feelings. Initially it was lifestyle inflation, but now it's personal competition. I want to see how much I can make, so I don't think I'll ever truly \"settle.\" Man, at $80k with the way the economy is going and the uncertainty surrounding everything about the world stage I would just consider myself to be lucky to 1. Be employed 2. Be college educated 3. Be gainfully employed 4. Make anything in the neighborhood of what is above survival pay.\n\nWhat's your degree in/what industry do you work in? 100% relate to this.\n\nMy first job out of college (23) was a respectable $25/hr in a relatively low COL area. A lot of people would be pretty happy with that.\n\nI left that job for another one in a much higher COL area and took an $85k salary a year later. Money was tight, (my rent doubled) but moving opened me to the next opportunity. I was at this job for not even three months before 90% of the company was laid off as the studio decided to stop making games and to focus on publishing. \n\nJob market in the new area was great, though, and I got a new job at $100k + ~$300k in stock over four years (so gross around $140k/year). Over six figures at 24! It was amazing. Lots of people would be over the moon for my salary. Unfortunately, I couldn't save much, but I finally was able to get out from under student loan debt (nearly 100k) and a car loan my parents talked me into while I was in high school.\n\nAround the end of my second year, I was promoted and given a raise, I was now at $120k base, plus the stock from earlier. Around this same time, I felt I was stagnating professionally and started looking for new jobs. \n\nAfter several months of searching and being pretty unhappy at my current job, I finally landed a new job (and new salary). I started at $275k, just turned 27. Nearly two years later, I'm making around $290k at the same job. For now I feel like I must be at the top of what I can make for where I am in my career. I'm thoroughly enjoying my job, but won't hesitate to leave if a better opportunity comes my way. \n\nThere's nothing wrong with wanting more money. Work for it and take chances. I never would have gotten where I am if it weren't for taking big risks, and even when those risks didn't pan out, there were other avenues to explore.

That's 120k from my job, I bring in 18k/year/rental also. My attitude really started to shift as the weight of providing for my family is lifted though. I used to think about nothing else but the amount of time I am missing raising my boys. Change career path and now only work 14 days a month, but I would like to work less still.

One reason I've heard that people lease or buy new cars under warranty is that they will never have to worry about repairs.\n\nOne other way to \"never have to worry about repairs\" is to save $100-200 per month and put it into a savings account earmarked for repairs. A savings account for repairs will take away all of the negative feelings associated with unexpected repairs. Your account is also likely to accumulate money over time that can be used for your next car purchase (if your first car was $2000 your second in a few years may be $5000).\n\nYou can actually drive a bit nicer cars, too. I had a $7000 Honda Civic for about 5 years and after depreciation and repairs it cost me on average less than $40/month. It was a car I liked a lot and when something did break, I actually felt good about spending the money to make the repair because that was what the money was for.", "title": "If you drive a used car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car repairs", "comments": "I make a car payment to myself every month. It's meant for reasonable repairs or maintenance on my car (\"reasonable\" = I'm not making a 6k repair on my car only worth 1.5k) and more hopefully buying a new car outright in a few years.  I also would encourage you to include your \"car payment\" in your emergency fund. Just in case you buy a new car and have a payment, it's already in your E-fund if you lose your job the next day. \n\nEdit: New car = New to me car. Although I dunno if I would buy one out right or buy one I'm able to pay off right away and make payments for 12 or so months to build the credit. This is (hopefully) years away from me and I'll make the decision then.  It's worth creating a sinking fund for car repairs and maintenance on newer cars, too. Oil changes, brakes, tires, and registration all cost money and on newer (more expensive) cars registration can be pretty pricey depending on where you live. Don't let these things become an unexpected expense! i do this too.\n\nSecond tip: Check out how much a car cost to maintain before buying it. A smaller car is much cheaper to run. 15\" tire are way cheaper than 17\"s, a smaller engine uses less engine oil, etc.  Your title rephrased: Save money for necessary expenditures in the future.\n\n This is exactly why PF advocates the value of an emergency fund. Cars aren't the only thing that can break and I wouldn't have a dedicated fund for one. I would just have a savings of several thousands of dollars. $1000 at least. Then when something/anything goes wrong, you can address it without going into debt. better yet, have emergency funds for anything that might go wrong.  hope for the best but plan for the worst Go one step further: every time you buy something that offers an *extra warranty* ask how much that warranty costs, then don't buy the warranty but deposit that money in a special account.  Do that for your car, electronics, etc.\n\nWhen then you need to repair/replace that piece by withdrawing form that account. Do the same for pets, too.  Before you get a dog or cat, set aside 2k for medical bills.   Another point to this I like to make, if applicable to your timing and location, repairing and maintaining a vehicle yourself is far cheaper than going to a dealer or shop. Most repairs for most popular makes and models are available online through forums and YouTube videos, and many are doable with a small tool set and a bit of time. \n\nFinal tip, maintenance is very important. You save a lot though by paying a little for maintenance instead of a lot for a major failure in the future. \n\nGoogle is your best friend in many of these aspects. A little research could save you a good chunk of money in the long run. >A savings account for repairs will take away all of the negative feelings associated with unexpected repairs.\n\nExcept, of course, the anxiety of having a car break down some place really inconvenient, like a highway, and then the possibility of not having a car for however long it takes to fix the car and having to come up with alternative transportation. \n\nAnd if you're already stashing $200/mo for repairs, why is that different from having a car payment for an inexpensive new car? \n\n Sure! My husband and I have a $4000 car and a $1000 car. We put $200 a month into the \"car\" fund and pay for car taxes, oil changes, AAA and any repairs out of that fund. It is sitting at $5k right now, so we even have the cash to replace either of the cars with a better one if one of them should permanently kick the bucket. Meh.  I think this is a mistake.\n\nYou should have a general savings fund with quite a bit more than that for all kinds of expenses that come up.  Trying to micromanage all your funds like this is a good way to either not follow you system or to not have the money you need (my washer broke down but I cannot use the car repair money).\n\nTry keeping a $10-15K emergency fund of cash.  It is life on easy mode. Nothing is a big deal anymore.\n\nAnd generally even on lower middle class incomes, that is achievable with a year or two of restraint in spending. I would also suggest learning some basic preventative maintenance. You would be surprised how much inspection and maintenance you can do on your own car with little experience or tools. This will save you a lot of money at the mechanic. For example:\n\nSuper Easy   \nCheck fluid levels.  \nCheck belts.  \nCheck tire pressure.  \n\nEasy  \nRotate Tires  \nChange Oil  \nChange Bulbs  \nChange battery  \nChange air filter  \n\nModerate  \nChange spark plugs  \n\nThere are more, but all of these can be done with only a few tools and watching youtube videos. This is bullshit\n\nYou can save up like this forever\n\n\nPut away 100 a month for that dream vacation \n\nOr for healthcare for the next 50 years\n\nOr put away 5 dollars a day for that steak dinner next week , \n\nHow about you just learn to save AS MUCH MONEY AS POSSIBLE so when you need $300 for a repair or $3000 for a down payment you will instead have waaaaay more saved and can pay cash for a new car every 7 years for the rest of your life Everyone who is driving a car is driving a used car. That's cool but, I'd just lump this in with the emergency fund.\n\nMy emergency fund is significant enough to never have to worry about a car going bad. I could drop enough to buy another one without any problem. Also see: \"Don't spend all your money so you have some to spend if things go wrong.\"  Here's a real protip for car ownership, from a mechanic.\n\nEvery car has parts designed to wear down and need replacing. If you read your owners manual it will tell you at what mileage intervals to replace some of those wear items.\n\nFluid levels (Brake/PowerSteering/Coolant/Oil/Transmission, etc) should be checked regularly. Things like belts/hoses/tires, and other rubber components should be checked periodically also.\n\nTLDR- Give your car a good once over periodically. The best way to prevent a $2,000 repair is to fix whatever needs attention before it becomes a major problem. Any car can easily last 200-300k miles, but basic maintenance and preventative repairs are necessary. 2 $300-400 repairs is much cheaper than single $1,500 repair when something fails catastrophically. If it's a German car, put $100-200,000 in.  My issue with this is you are not saving any money this way versus a new vehicle while also losing value on something that is less reliable than a new vehicle. You are increasing risk while having no real reward to show for it. $200 a month for emergency repairs translates into a $10,000-$12,000 vehicle. Buying slightly used (2-3 years old) will put you in that price range while still allowing you to have a warranty and some piece of mind that the vehicle won't spontaneously fail you. New cars depreciate 20%-30% in the first 2 years but only another 20-30% over the next 3-5 years. Buying the 2-3 year old vehicle, driving it for 5 years, then buying another also makes for a nicer ladder than used + savings.\n\nUsed + savings uses the formula: Monthly savings + Used car value = \"new\" car value.\nNew car purchases uses: Car value + Loan payment = New (or \"new\") car value.\n\nSo lets use $200 a month as suggested. For a \"new\" car at $10,000 vs a beater valued at $1,000. The $1,000 car has a risk, reward calculation but lets say the used car lasts on average a year without needing repair work and you replace them after a year while the \"new\" car makes it 5 without anything major happening.\n\nBeater value after 20 years: Lets assume an average 20% per year value drop for the used car (you are trashing it after it breaks down after all.) Your next car is then worth 2400+.8X=X. Basically, take your total yearly savings, divide it by .8, and that is your eventual cap on a cars value should nothing ever go wrong. In the $200 a month case that caps you at a $12,000 car.\n\n\"New\" car value after 20 years: Lets assume a 60% drop in value after each car (an 8 year old vehicle will still run and sell.) Your next car is worth $10,000+.4X=X So, for the same price per month, you cap at a vehicle worth around $17,000. If you instead leave the cars value the same and save the extra per month after each vehicle upgrade you can pay in full for a slightly cheaper than cap vehicle. Lets assume $10,000 each vehicle, same 60% price drop, but saving the difference. 2nd car costs you $6,000 in loans ($100/month about), 3rd car is $10,000 but has no loan ($100*60+$4,000) and 4th car is worth either $10,000 which you paid in full for $6,000 with $6,000 sitting in the bank or $16,000 clearing out your bank account. (This will eventually lead you to a $18,000 vehicle cap)\n\nIn both cases the cars depreciation and length of service can vary wildly, however, the newer cars will likely have fewer repairs needed than the beaters over the same time period and be more reliable during that time. If you get lucky with a beater you can come out ahead but the newer car calculation is less risk and has a higher return over time than the beater unless you get lucky.\n\nTLDR: Newer is better than beater. Get the best one you can afford and aim for that 2-3 year old range as most of the depreciation has already hit the cars price. * \"If you drive a ~~used~~ car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car repairs\" warranties do not cover normal maintence and wear and tear.....but its always good to have a sum of money earmarked for repairs and upkeep of your car...and in many cases its still cheaper to fix than to buy another, especially if your car is paid for. Doesn't need to be its own account... just make a budget category for car repairs and keep it funded.  That's essentially what an e-fund is for. Same concept. I just cut all the rubbish and save based off a budget and any emergencies, birthdays, etc. that occur just get taken out my efund account that is allocated for such things. Something will ALWAYS happen in life. Keeping money aside for when it does is important.  If you drive a used car, you are an adult(ish) and should have an emergency fund, preferably for at least 1 month worth of expenses. \n\nSeriously though, get an emergency fund. It will save your ass over and over and you wont have to put emergencies on credit cards which can really end up fucking you in the long run.  I got done with all this and just learned to work on cars. There has been jobs that Firestone on the dealer would quote me $800-$1200 for and I did for like 1/4 of that.\n\n\nMy cost - \nRadiator - $150 \nHalf axles - $200\nAll 4 struts - $350 \nBreak pads and rotors - $100 \n\nShop cost \nRadiator - $500+\nHalf axles $800-1000++\nAll 4 struts -$1500\nBreak pads and rotors - $400+\n\nWhile I've invested quite a bit in tools and time, I at least get to keep those, and have gained life long knowledge. \n\nIt has been a godsend for when my car does break down. I had my radiator hoses split over this last summer on the highway. Literally popped the hood, went \"well....alright\", got an uber to the nearest autozone, purchased the hoses and coolant I needed, and was back on the road in my car in the space of an hour and a half and maybe $50\n(I also drive a shitty Impala so I keep some tools in the trunk just for this)  Isn't every car a used car once you start driving it? I totally agree. There are absolutely good cars for under $3000. I also put away money for repairs every month so that I don't have any big surprises. Fortunately my good old Honda Civic hasn't had any big surprises. The most I've spent on one repair for my 1998 Civic is $400. I have owned it for six years and it has a lot of KM/Mi on it.\n\nYou pay for repairs on a new car too. You just don't know it because it's all hidden in the cost of the vehicle. For some people it's worth it and they can afford it but most can't and end up car poor. Unless it's a Land Rover, better add a couple of zeros.. Everybody drives a used car. Whoa. Honestly I would put $100-200 away for car maintenance even if I had a brand spanking new car. Why not just save $500+ a month for savings/emergency and use as needed? How many savings accounts do I need? Every other day I am being told to put money in a different specific savings account. And then move to 1962 when $100-$200 would actually cover the costs of most minor repairs.  On a related note, I hear a lot of people say you shouldnt be spending more money on a repair than the car is worth. I disagree with this in some situations.\n\nIf I can sell my Jeep for $2,000 and it needs a $2,500 repair, I'd argue that repair is worth it provided:\n\n- Im comfortable driving it (I dont hate it / desperately want a different car)\n- I own the car\n- The $2,500 is less than I'd spend on a payment (down payment + monthly) for a replacement car over the amount of time I'm confident the Jeep can be reliable transportation for me\n\nAlso, people dont seem to factor in that the car worth $2,000 before the breakdown is not going to sell for $2,000 broken (dealers / buyers are pretty good at negotiating you down if they have valid reasons like this).\n\nBasically my thought is put off replacing the car as long as you're comfortable with (this car is old so my friends give me shit, this car is no longer reliable), because its rare that extra maintenance on an older car will be more expensive than down payment + monthly on a new car. Keep an eye out for when you hit this point, but it should be pretty obvious!\n\nCurious if anyone looks at it the same way. I like the idea of a depreciation/repair/maintenance fund for any big ticket item.\n\nFor big ticket items, figure out how long you think that thing will last, how much you need to replace it, and then divide that into a monthly savings.  Round up a little to make math easy and for a bit of an excess slush fund.\n\nExample: a new washer/dryer costs $2000.  Average life of a washer/dryer is 10 years. $200/year. $20/month.\n\nOr:  Car tires are $1000 a set and last 4 years. Oil changes are approx $40 and happen 4x a year. $410/year. $40/month. Does everybody in the US do crazily high miles to warrant really high maintenance. It is 30 times bigger than the UK after all. I live in London and do about 8,000 miles per year and maintenance is nothing like the figures I see on here and that is for multiple different cars over the years. Are a lot of you guys doing 25k+ per year? [deleted] LPT: If you drive an old car because you don't have a lot of money, have a lot of money to be able to save.  You could also just buy a Toyota instead of a jeep/fiat/ford. My dad just laughs as my mothers side of the family goes through shitty car after shitty car while all our Toyotas still run perfectly (even the used ones & even his FJ62 from 1988). Seriously never buy a jeep!  If I had 200 bucks to put away I wouldn't be driving a used car. Or just have an emergency fund and factor auto maintenance into your monthly budget. I found a beater takes around $100/month on average over 5 years. I did quite a bit myself too.  You mean you guys aren't ordering $50 - $150 dollars in parts every week?  Shit Yeah 100-200 should cover it. Just don't be surprised when you take it in for repairs and the bills 1700$ Also, if you've got extra free time on your hands and don't mind spending a good 4-6 hours (depending on the job, your experience levels, and car make and model), you could easily cut your costs down by 80% by simply doing the repairs yourself.\n\nI've spent a total of just above $900 for parts, and I did everything myself. I've redone all the vacuum lines, replaced the PCM with brand new Spark Plugs, Coil Packs and wiring harness, intake gaskets, alternator, serpentine belt, and brake pads and rotors. About half of that alone with parts and labor with be waaayy over $1,000. Just as a heads up, things like steering racks would easily be 800, and things like tires are by no means cheap. I'd say if you have $1000 saved, atleast be willing to spend it all on car repairs if need be. How about \"have an emergency fund\" and get car advice from knowledgeable people (ie. not some of the people ITT) Just because you spent more doesn't necessarily make for a more reliable car. Maintenance costs will vary. And your brand new car isn't invulnerable to needing non-warranteed work. Another LPT: Keep $50-100 stashed somewhere in the car for emergencies. If you break down somewhere, that bit of cash can come in very handy. You can do that but you can also lease a civic brand new for like $200 per month and never have to worry about breaking down on your way somewhere.... If you drive a used [by someone else first] car.\n\nTo all the people trying to nitpick the title, this bracketed portion which is implied and understood by everyone else has been added to help you out of your confusion. You're welcome. $200 a month? I figure you could buy/lease a Toyota yaris or base Corolla for that or not much more.  This should really be any car.\n\nContrary to popular belief, new car warranty does not cover everything that will brake. Good advice but the sum is too small.  Replacing all four brakes and rotors costs at least twice that.\n\nEDIT: I read too fast and missed the \"per month\" part.  Brakes, tires, and other wear-and-tear items are always more expensive than you think, but $100 - $200/month should be enough to cover most situations. I like this post. I've gotten a lot out of my cars for as little as possible. \n\nI keep a separate checking account and pay all my car expenses out of it, except for gas. I budget that with my grocery, and free money since they all tend to balance each other depending in what I do. \n\nAnd then I have a monthly budget and I stick money away every week towards an annual average budget. For me, when money starts hanging around it makes me take care of the car but it also makes it easier to track and minimize expenses by earmarking money and sticking to planned maintenance spending with a small cushion. \n\nPlus, I pay my insurance for a while year to save money and, and since I started it with a large budget and kept paying in constantly I have a decent savings should I need a new car. \n\nThe two best things you can do as a car owner is realize a car beyond basic integrity is a total waste, and fix it til it's dead. Maybe have a second utility or ego vehicle but drive your cars til they die, and take care of them. Don't go cheap on tires. And rotate them. \n\nYou save a lot of money if you have a good place that'll rotate tires with an oil change. Keeping up on repairs is easy between oil changes and inspection time. Change your fluids as needed and get things flushed. It really does save you repairs and car life. It's way cheaper than a new car. Easy on the gas and easy on the brakes saves you a lot of money. \n\n If you don't have a car payment, place a \"car payment\" into a savings, CD, mutual fund, etc. Each month.  It'll teach you to budget for a car payment and you'll have a nice down payment after a year or so :) Um... I bought a cheap new car, and the payment is around $200 a month... and I don't have to worry about repairs.  As a mechanic this is very sound advice. I would like to add though you should really learn to do minor repairs yourself. Things like oil changes, blown bulbs, even brakes are very easy repairs that can cost A LOT of your hard earned money. With Google and Youtube these are things you can do in your driveway with a $20 tool set. For older cars oil changes can be done in as little as 15min and cost less than $30. I work on semi's now and also handle our after hours breakdown line. I get multiple calls a week for blown lights that cost $3 and end up paying a shop  $65 dollars to replace. Oil changes are a big thing that if done regularly will save you a lot of trouble. Better yet learn to do some basic maintenance and how to fix it.  LMAO...One day I'll be rich enough where I can just leave $100-$200 somewhere without needing it No need.\n\nThat's what income tax returns that you planned on using for something entirely necessary that you've been saving and just waiting for the income tax return to put you in a safe zone are for.\n\nOf course your car learns of these plans beforehand.Maybe you did some planning in the vehicle,made some calls...whatever.\n\nIt now knows and is plotting on the perfect timing for when to \"shut er down\" so you don't get to spend one thin dime how you hoped.\n\n Unless you can make your own repairs, or are good friends with the mechanic, $100-200 fixes hardly anything. The real advice is, if your in the market to buy a vehicle, set aside a couple thousand and continue to add to that savings account monthly if possible. It will add up quick and allows you plenty of buying power whether its for repairs, new tires, or even a down payment.  Good advice but if you really want to be safe I'd increase that amount by a factor of ten If you buy a ford you need to put 5-7k away just to be safe Pro tip, new car repairs cost as much or more than used car repairs. If it's \"covered under warranty\" that's great! But, It's always important to have money set aside for car repairs.\nAlso, might want to bump that up to like 300-500 or learn to do the repairs yourself > If you drive a ~~used~~ car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car repairs\n\nFTFY\n\nNew and old, all cars run into unexpected issues. Since when are repairs. In the 100-200 dollar range?  I think 500 or 600 would be more appropriate. Technically every car is used. [deleted] every car that you drive is a used car  \n\n\n/runs away Never lease a car.  That's like renting a house the rest of your life.  Worst deal in auto sales for the buyer.  Or buy 200 bucks in tools and crank up YouTube.  I have a 2000 Dodge Durango I came really close to junking 6 months ago. Instead, with a whole lot of help from YouTube and some internet research, I got it into perfect running shape for about 2k total III making a new set of tires.  I have no experience with cars other than oil changes and was able to do these things:\n\nAlternator\nPower steering pump\nNew negative terminal\nHeater core\nBlower motor\nEvaporator\n3 lock actuators\n1 window regulator\nBrakes\nSerpentine belt\nTensioner pulley\nIdler pulley\nSway bar links\nShocks\nBalls joints\nControl arms\nDryer\nInner and outer tie rods\n\n\nCar runs absolutely perfectly now and I've got no car payment.  Putting that money into a house I can't afford instead.  Just takes a little curiosity. This probably will get buried but if you want a solid car for pretty cheap, learn to drive manual.\n\nYou can get a lower mileage commuter car for a seriously cheap price since majority of people do not know how to drive manual and want a sports car in manual.  Also, learn how to do work yourself. 85% of the work you need to do on your car, that you'll pay HUNDREDS or THOUSANDS to get done, can be done in your driveway in a few hours for tens of dollars. \n\nI delivered pizza for 5 years. I don't have my old spreadsheets anymore, but I saved myself nearly 1 full years worth of salary (it was somewhere between $25,000 and $35,000) over that time DOING THE WORK MYSELF.  I have an emergency fund for this purpose, but it's a great idea to actually contribute 100-200 a month exclusively for the car so even if it's totaled and you don't have collision coverage, the money is there to buy something else to drive while not impacting that break-glass fund. I might do this moving forward. Thanks! That's what I do. Or sort of. I do the envelope thing to keep cash straight. I put $200 aside for gas for the month and only end up using $50-70 of that and put the rest aside for oil, repairs, or a new car if necessary.  I've been putting $100 in savings from every paycheck. So far every time my car broke down I had JUST enough money in savings to fix it. My car seems to only need major repairs, lol.\n\nDefinitely prepare for the day your car breaks down, because it will come. My wife and I did just that a few years ago. We started it with two good working cars that were paid off. Let it grow, and last year the two working cars quickly became two non-working cars. One car everything started to break every month, ran the numbers it would be cheaper to replace it than to keep up with the repairs. And out of the blue the transmission went out on the 2nd car. With 2 used car payments, it is about the same as what we were putting away. So that money isn't missed.  I'm in this exact situation right now. My car was totaled last week (rear ended at a stoplight) and I'm not worried about much. I've got a  $10K emergency fund, plus the amount I'm getting from the insurance payout. I'm planning on buying a $2k-$4k car to replace mine, which I'll be able to pay cash for even before insurance cuts me the check. Without that emergency fund, I'd be freaking out about how I'm going to get to work and get around town until I was able to save up enough for a decent car.  I don't put savings per se but I always budget monthly for maintenance - just dividing your yearly maintenance into the year.  My dad always told me, \"any time you have your car repaired and it cost less than $300, you should pretend it's free.\"\n\nCars are expensive. Buying the car is only the start. I used to do this. Now I work for an automaker so it's pretty close in cost for my price. Not only do I agree with this, i'd like to expand on it. \n\nI'd suggest putting away a car payment each month, even if you do not have a car payment. In a couple of years, you will be able to buy the next car outright with cash. \n\nThe emotional feeling is pretty amazing. Not only is the car buying experience better because you are rewarding yourself with this new shinny thing because you've saved for several years, there is no buyers remorse after. \n\nI do this for vacation too, similar affect. \n\nCJ I feel like a big problem for me is the way PF dictates having all these different funds (Emergency fund, car repair fund, home repair fund, savings, etc). It seems like if the people on here don't earmark money for a specific fund or savings then they find a way to spend the money. \n\n\nHave an emergency fund (savings account) and have your regular bank account. Pay your bills and save the rest. If there is something you really really really want or something that you need then buy it. If you don't need it or want it that bad then don't buy it. \n\n\nIt seems like a lot of people let \"money burn a hole in their pocket\" ... and if it's a Jeep ZJ, put in a couple thousand!\n\nJ.E.E.P.= Just Empty Every Pocket I drive a new car and do this for consumable items like tyres.  $800 for a set of 4 tires is not a small expense.\n\n When I had my last junky used car, I put $150 a month into a separate account in case of major repairs. After a while, I had enough saved to be used as a down payment for a much nicer car.  I bought a 2000 Toyota Avalon with 85k miles for $7100 in 2009 or early 2010. I put $2000 in it since then (preventative maintenance, brakes, tires). So all told I've had a car for $1500/year for the past 6 years. (Plus gas, oil, insurance). And there is no end in sight.  i just have a \"car fund\" that i contribute to every single paycheck. when i don't have a car loan then i'm just building up the fund for my next car purchase. and when i do have a car loan 1) it comes directly from this account 2) the monthly payment is less than what i'm contributing so i'm building up a cushion for unexpected charges or for my next car. Before buying any used car, get a prepurchase inspection. They cost like 100 bucks. So dont sign that paperwork until its done. Then whatever needs to be fixed, have the dealership selling the car fix it for you before you buy it.  This is pretty much the basic idea of car insurance. While this is not a bad idea, if you actually know how to fix the car you own, you'd be better off putting a little extra cash in savings every month.\n\nThe only way to actually never have to worry about repairs is learning more about your vehicle, finding out how often it needs to be taken for things like oil changes and other fluid changes, and learning how to break a car in correctly. Aside from car accidents which is covered by insurance companies, it's more about how people take care of their vehicles vs expecting to repair a car every month from something that goes wrong. I automatically contribute $50/mo into a specific \"Auto Repair\" account. Saturday I had to drop $800 to fix my radiator. Fortunately I had the money to do it. \n\nBonus Tip: **Always negotiate repair/maintenance costs**. The original quote was $985 but I said, \"Aw, man, that's gonna wipe me out. Is there anything we can do on that price?\" Instant 20% discount just for asking.  And this was at a national chain, no less.  Just to note, be REASONABLE with repairs. I spent about 3k on a 95 camry with 135k for a new engine and AC compressor. Probably was not the smartest thing I could have done (should have replaced the car) Even better: make a \"car payment\" into this account every month. You'll draw interest instead of paying it, and when the time comes to get another car you might have the cash for it. Yea I can afford that Save 100/month for ur dental/health visits too. Your body needs help sometimes too One strategy for dealing with money is to do this with all irregular purchases. Buying a new TV? Take the cost of it, divide by how many months you expect to use it before it's time to replace it, and put aside that amount every month. When the time is up you've already \"paid\" for the next one. Can't afford to put aside the money every month? Probably a good indication that you can't afford what you want to buy in the first place. Even if you have a new or car. Especially an SUV it's not fun when you have to replace the factory tires.  Who buys a car and doesn't think it'll need repairs or that repairs are somehow free? I'm all for a budget, but this sounds geared to a low IQ audience I had posted this in another thread, but it was ignored/I was late to the party:\n\n\n\nThis is what I do for my daily driver (i own a couple of hot rods, too).\n\nThis is totally possible. You'll need to learn basic mechanic skills but you can learn as you go along doing maintainence and small, cheap repairs, and it can be enjoyable while being a good thing to have knowledge of. \n\nInvest in a 2-300 dollar basic hand tool set, get a jack, jack stands etc. Basic obvious stuff.\n\nJust do research before buying. A lot of people that do this stick to one make or model. I like old GM vans. My wife drives old Hondas. A friend drives old Toyotas. Japanese cars are usually well built and will last a long time if taken care of. Crown Victoria cop cars are a great deal if you can find one and will run forever. (Old domestic rear wheel drive cars are a lot easier to work on, in general). Hondas and Toyotas are well built and last and can be found cheap.\n\nThe biggest advice I can give is to budget away 100-150 bucks a month for each old car in your household. Cars do break. You'll want to perform regular preventive maintainence (oil/fluid changes, brakes, wearable stuff). Learn to DIY. Then that 100 bucks a month accrued covers most things when the car is due for something or to get a new used tire when I need one or an emergency repair when I can't do it myself for whatever reason. (Get AAA, too- that card can be a life saver). But as a mechanic, people that drive used cars spend about 1500 bucks a year just keeping it running. Sometimes a 300 dollar repair bill is worth it. \n\nYouTube is your new best friend. If you don't know how to do something, look it up on Youtube, there will be 50 different videos that show you what to do for any and everything.\n\nThe thing is to recognize when the car becomes a money pit. Time to park it in the backyard to use in the future for parts and go buy another one. See why it's good to stick to one type of car? I have two vans back there now I've been using for parts for my current van when I can. Saved $250 on a new radiator last week.\n\nThere will be fucked up situations like having your timing chain commit engine homicide by giving up on the Interstate while you are late for work one day. Or something. It will happen, you'll be late and it'll be pain in the ass to have to find a new ride, but just remember- you don't have a car payment. It's happened to me twice in 30 years. \n\nYou just learn to keep your eyes peeled. I watch Craigslist and FB for old Chevy vans, I stumbled across my current for $1500 from the original owner, it had just 98K on it and he had receipts for everything that had ever been done. At the time I had $600 in my car account so I only had to come up with the other 8 on short notice. It has a working original NES console, TV and queen sized bed in the back. I can live in the fucker if I ever need to. \n\nGood luck\n\n            I drive an old car and do everything myself. Everytime It breaks I sit down and learn the job. I buy the tools, and I do it. It sucks, but I often can feel it before it gives out, and can f8x it super fast the next time, because I know the job. \n\nI feel like newer cars prevent this bonding, forcing you to take it in for repairs because of all the specialty tools and covers.  I've posted this before but I'll put it up again. My father has cursed me with this car logic that I cannot shake so I will let you guys in on it.\n\nMy dad only bought used cars. His rationale went like this:\n\n>If a new car payment is ~$200 a month and I buy a car for $1,000, that car should last me 5 months before I need to put any work into it.\n\n>If 3 months in to owning the car something breaks, the same logic is used to determine whether or not to fix it. So, if I spend $1K on a car that should last me 5 months and then have to put another $400 into it, that car has now cost me $1,400 and therefore should last 7 months.\n\nIf the car lasts after this assessed time frame, that is gravy to my father. My younger brother bought his first car (used) awhile ago (he's in his very early 20s).  A mid 2000s Mazda 3.  My God... the amount of repairs and general car care (things like winter tires, an oil change, etc).  And that's on top of the ridiculous cost of insurance for young people and gas.  I've been pretty turned off from driving already but just seeing how quickly a car eats away at one's wallet, I think I'm swearing off of them for life, or at least until I begin living with a significant other that provides a second income. At first I thought you meant that you should only keep a few hundred for repairs, and then realized you meant to do it monthly and accrue a balance.\n\nI was like loooooooooooooooooooooooooooool, but I drive a 2003 Volvo. That wouldn't fix anything ;) This is something that should be done with every vehicle. One should save up to the amount it takes to purchase and install the most expensive part. The $100-200 suggestion is if you drive a used Honda or Toyota right? If you drive a Ford or Dodge, the recommended savings amount should be equal to the cost of buying a replacement car. If you would prefer to repair, rather than replace, then the recommended savings amount should be equal to 1.5-2x the value of your current car. >If you drive a used car...\n\nShould just say  *a car older than ~X years*. It doesn't matter so much if it's new (to you) or used; it's more about the age and mileage. I've been very lucky. Have had a 1995 Cabrio convertible that I bought in 2013 for $1300 Canadian. Hasn't broke down once. Fun car too. Last year they made then in Germany apparently. I'm just driving it until it breaks down cause any repair now in this ripoff generation is going to cost over $1000.  Girls dig being in a convertible too.  If only it cost $200 to service and repair my car... And remember, a car becomes used the moment you drive it out of the showroom. that's not going very far in repairs I'll say a couple things.   You should save in general and not touch it... maybe you tell yourself what it's for of course but this applies in general.   In other words if I have 200 bucks left over I save it anyway,  I don't blow it unless I can think of a use , I put it all away and there is nothing \"left over\" after saving since I budget the rest already.  Once in a while, as a guilty pleasure I dip into it and I \"can\" because I'm usually dumping as much as possible there every month or even more frequently. \n\nSell something on ebay and don't NEED the money?  Saved.\nUnexpected cash gift?  Saved.  Even 10 bucks. \nPeople know if they want me to actually use money, to give me a gift card.\n\n\nNow on to cars:  I'm mechanically inclined.   That's a huge factor not just for their initial selection of a car but your ability to cheaply repair the car or to rescue yourself on the side of the road.   Someone less inclined may need to tow the car to a shop, some one more inclined may end up with a story about \"you'll never guess what my shitbox did this time at 2am on route 146...\" but still make it home if at all possible.\n\nShitbox or not you should always carry :\n\nA belt for the car and the means to replace it (most new cars, it's just a certain size socket or long wrench )\nA drivers side windshield wiper\nA tire plug kit and can of fix a flat-  for instance in a snow storm it may not be feasible to jack the car up, once in a blue moon this happens or imagine you run something over and blow out 2 tires in the middle of noplace. Just saying- many many new cars also have no spare tire and if you buy it used the can of tire sealer and the air pump could be missing.  Replace them.\n\nJumper cables,  road flares.\nA quart of oil and if at all possible one of those emergency gas\njugs(they have these, with like a gallon of emergency fuel, enough to get you to a station ).. as smart and watchful as you might be on the gauge the gauge can break too.\nA blanket of course and some kind of emergency food like candy bars and you can replace those every so often..\n\nI know most of this isn't finance but with all the talk of driving shit boxes to save money I wanted to offer my advice. \n\nI bought a brand new subaru BRZ in 2013. Because of my ability to drive shit boxes without incident I've been able to avoid using the BRZ for my 40k a year job.  If I hadn't done that I'd have like 150k on the car by now,  instead that mileage has only cost me a couple grand instead of most of the usable life of a 25k car...  I would not be able to comfortably afford to replace a 25k car every 4-5 years and still save,   and with my high mileage per year a lease would not work at all.  \n\nThat being said if you are not very comfortable doing small repairs yourself and checking your car every couple weekends and making note of needed service, fluid levels and etc then I would say you should save up in cash to avoid the interest and buy a 5-10 thousand dollar car from a dealership.  I would suggest you go to a big branded dealer, they will have used cars and reconditioned trades and you will great bargaining power in cash. I've had nothing but used cars and, since we do all of our own repairs, it never costs us that much. \nGranted, we have the skills and tools available to us, so perhaps this is a good idea for most people but I might suggest at least figuring out how to do basic maintenance yourself.  If you drive a used car chances are you won't have $100-$200 to be able to save in the first place. Know someone with a garage? Learn to change your own bakes and brake pads. It will save you hundreds in the long run. $100-200 seems really low, i'd have atleast 2 grand earmarked specifically for car repairs. > If you drive a ~~used~~ car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car repairs    \n\nFTFY   \n\nYou *never* want to run out of money and not have your means to get to your job.  I also do this but instead of paying myself. My work pays me the federal mileage (53.5 \u00a2 per mile for 2017)\n\nSo far just in January I've totaled $270\n\nIt's usually about $100-$200 a month due to travel requirements.\n\nIn the 3 years I've had my car, all service visits have been fully paid for out of this and I still have $2000 left over in my account.\n\n If you drive a new car, put $100-200 in a savings account specifically earmarked for car maintenance. Everybody drives a used car so this would be beneficial to everybody. This should be standard practice for car ownership regardless of the age or state of your car... unless you are like me and drive bumper cars everywhere and obsess about the clear coat Well yeah, my uncle told me: when you buy an used car keep at least 500 bucks for the first month. I just simply put $80 a month into an envelope for car stuff. It builds up over time and then we spend it down. We put a cap on it if $1000 This is why I have 2 used cars, and no payments on either. Granted, one is a running project ('98 Z/28, I'm $7000 into building the thing up now), but my other is my truck, and it requires little to nothing to keep running. All of the weak parts I replace with higher end heavy duty parts, and while I have some extra vibration from this (steel shaft, HD U-joints, etc), as a daily runner vehicle, it doesn't bother me at all.\n\nI do agree with having money set aside if you're buying any used vehicle, regardless of age. Hell, have money set aside from your car payments for repairs on even a new car these days, they're just not using the same quality metals and composites in the new vehicle parts as they used to pre-2000's. I had a mechanic I took all my cars to who told me if I was spending more than $200 a month on repairs, I should just buy a new car. He wasn't wrong.  I drive a 2010 Hyundai Elantra that I purchased brand new in September of 2010. She now has 216k on her. (I drive ALOT). \n\nI had horrible credit and +4K negative equity due to rolling in the remaining balance from my prior vehicle.\n\nWhen you drive as much as I do, you hit maintenance milestones considerably faster that the average driver. Now, my car did come with a 100k powertrain warranty, but the minute I drove her off the lot, I started putting money away.\n\nShe turned out to be a great decision because short of self-inflicted and scheduled maintenance  repairs, the only things that I have had to repair are a few resistors.\n\nI paid her off this past August and chose to keep the same amount in car payments on auto-pay to a checking account. This way, when I purchase a new vehicle, I will have a down payment at least. I learned the hard way about negative equity. \n\nMy mechanic told me that the 'magic number' for repair costs is $500, meaning any repairs over $500 from here going forward means that i trade in the car.\n\n216k on a 2010 means no trade in value. But i suppose I could sell her privately for $500. I am deadset on driving her into the ground - so long as its FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE to do so! In addition to this. I never budget 100% of my paycheque. I always make sure after all my budgeting I have a few hundred left over. For exactly situations like this.  How about \"have an emergency fund\" and get car advice from knowledgeable people (ie. not some of the people ITT) Just because you spent more doesn't necessarily make for a more reliable car. Maintenance costs will vary. And your brand new car isn't invulnerable to needing non-warranteed work. Additional note: People buy new cars claiming \"It's under warranty, I just make the payments and there are no repairs!\"... well, that doesn't include tires, which can run you $600 or more depending on size when needing replaced. Or other wear items such as brakes. If you drive a car you do this.  Doesn't everyone drive a used car?  My friends ask me why i have no money at end of month, this is one of the reasons, i allocate $70-100 a month for car repairs. I would say $1000 set aside is much better. Sometimes the $100-200 range covers a set of wheels or so but if the engine goes out and you need to replace that it's much favorable to have more set aside. \n\nBe a little realistic and not only consider the common issues that may come with a car. I disagree with the amount, maybe 1000 saved for car repairs.  Become a AAA member...Saves a ton of dough in towing fees. GEICO has a roadside assistance built in to their coverage. Your assurance may as well.\n \nPlan (and budget) on replacing these items on the 'new to you' car within 12 months...Tires, battery, fan belts, headlights, shocks absorbers and or struts **and** the **timing belt(!)** especially if you have an 'interference' engine. Interference designs(as opposed to non-interference) will have the valves meet the pistons if this belt breaks. Not cheap to fix AT ALL! (usu. new engine) If in doubt about when the timing belt was replaced, cheaper to replace it 20,000 miles too soon than 1 foot too late.\nThere is a lot of value left in most car chassis and powertrains but most Americans don't do the maintenance when scheduled. Forget looks and extra and buy healthy powertrains. A lot of basic car repair can be done yourself. Spend some time to learn a little and it'll save you a ton of money. Will also be useful if something g happens on the road.  100 - 200 seems a little low imo I mean $200 a month is quite a lot especially for just car repairs. This can also end up fucking you over out of money that could be saved elsewhere.\n\nLets be real, if you buy a used car 3~ years old and you buy from a dealer and not from a person, you can negoitate a service and an MOT with the car. That's going to last you 12 months. Saving $50 a month and putting the extra $150 towards a seperate savings account would still leave you with $600 after the year was up. This fund is a car expenses fund. $600 is enough to buy your new tires, service and MOT. At least here in the UK that would still leave you with a hundred or so going forward. Any big repairs going to cost you $1k+ are probably not worth the cost unless you are investing long term into this vehicle.\n\nOnce one major thing goes on a car you can expect a long list within 24 months. Shortly after I bought my first house, I used an home equity line to pay off my car.  I think made $400/month payments (really auto-deductions) to save for a new car.  After 4 years I had about $20k saved and bought a nice 2-3 year old, low-mileage vehicle (and no note).  Continued to save now $450/month and 4 years later replaced my wife's car with a $25k car ($22k saved plus $3k selling her used care) - again 2 years old, low-mileage.  Another 4 years and saving $500/month, I replaced my car.  For 20 years I have followed this pattern.  I buy 2-3 years old and keep them for 8 years; replacing one every 4 years.  When the older car is up around 9-10 years old, there are always repairs, but I pay for that and maintenance/tires separately.   Contingency funds are paramount. I also recommend making the payments automatic. This way, you become used to your new monthly budget whilst saving.  My car cost $300 (well \u00a3245 actually), if I have to pay more than $150 for a repair I'll probably sell it or part it *shrugs*.  If you drive a used car, put $1000-2000 in a bank account specifically marked \"payments\" Im in australia. And i'm curious as to how much a decent set of tires are in america and other countries? The way I \"never have to worry about repairs\" is just to have two cars.  As a bonus my house always looks semi-occupied with vehicles in the driveway and stuff. Everyone drives a used car.  Showertought: Every car you drive, it's a used car. \n\nYou should make an effort to always give them proper maintenance. Good advice. Just paid 140 for an oil change and coolant flush. To bad I didn't have savings so I put it on a credit card :( A replacement engine cost more than $200 This is what I do. I drive my car for a living, so it gets a lot of mileage and having it out of commission isn't an option. I put $50 a week into a separate account that I use for everything from oil changes to major repairs. Makes it a lot easier when I need to get something expensive done out of the blue. This is good advice until you need to say, replace your roof and then...... I'm sorry but many repairs on $3k cars will cost much more than $100 a month. I get paid mileage reimbursement for my job at the Federal rate (53.5 cents/mile), which is way more than I spend on gas. The reimbursement checks go straight into a savings account. Less than 4 months on the job and I'm at about $1600, and that's with taking a few hundred to cover some bills. The rest is, however, set aside as a general emergency fund. \n\nOf course, not everyone gets reimbursements like that. But, I wish this was advice I had followed with my last car (an '03 MINI, which had a lot of expensive issues).  Doesn't everyone drive a used car? Technically every driven car is a used car... When planning your emergency fund, add in your deductible (for anything that needs it). \n How much do car repairs cost you? More like 1k Fuck. Do repairs cost that much? $100 a month?\n\nI guess I'll never be able to drive until I finish my PhD. I can't spend so much for parking, plus insurance, plus gas, plus maintenance. Wouldn't creating a new account just for this cause un-necessary bank fees? Also why a savings account and not an investment account? Same idea on a different scale. I priced out a car new for $60,000 that came with a 3 year/45k mile bumper to bumper warranty. I went to Carmax and found similar/same car 3-4 years old with less than 30k miles and was out the door for under $35k which included a bumper to bumper warranty that I built into the price that covered the car for 6 years / 150k miles. So I got almost the same car for a lot less and with a warranty that far exceeds the one I would get from the factory.  Part of owning a vehicle is putting money away for maintenance, repairs and consumables (tires, spark plugs, bulbs, filters, brakes, hoses, belts ...). So many forget this, then panic when their full-sized SUV needs $800 in tires.\n You should have several thousand dollars in savings earmarked for unexpected expenses anyway.\n\n$100-200 for car repairs is pretty optimistic. When people say \"worry about repairs\", a lot of that is the hassle of actually having to deal with a constantly broken car.  Then again, new cars can have issues, too, but generally less so than a $3,000 car.  People that drive $3,000 cars tend to be more lenient when it comes to things like having to press on the window to roll it up or having to use a pair of vice grips to keep the hood open, things that a new car owner would not tolerate.  There's also the big repairs like \"the whole fucking motor is completely fucked\" that can cost as much as the car itself in some cases, which new car owners never have to worry about.  The key is buying new and taking care of it, I've hardly had to do anything on any car I've owned beyond basic maintenance because I don't tear it up by driving like a dumbass, spilling drinks on the electronics, or ignoring maintenance schedules like a lot of people do. I have a separate savings account with Ally bank that I keep my emergency fund and car maintenance fund in. I do all of my own car repairs (save transmission and clutch work) and I've been keeping a spread sheet so that I can calculate average parts cost and time spent. Although I'm not repairing or changing fluids every single month, if I were to spread out the costs over 12 months it comes out to about $37.50. So, I transfer that to my savings account every month. Some years I don't spend it all but that's OK because when the time comes that I would like to change vehicles I can tap that fund and it's just that much less that I have to save up (I always buy vehicles with cash). It isn't a surprise that cars are one of the most financially unsound investments to make, as it always depreciates in value while at the same time increasing in maintenance costs.  Saving 10% at least is the *bare minimum* of what you should be considering for repairs alone.\n\nBack in the day (early 2000s) the average domestic car was expected to be owned for only 5 years, and the manufacturers developed them as such.  Now, the average person is owning cars for 7+ years on average, so the companies are having to increase their value.\n\nAnd yes, being an old truck owner myself, I can certainly say my maintenance costs are considerably lower than buying a new truck, but still hovers between 5-30% per year.  The blue book value of my truck is 5k. Reddit got way too into the used car thing, considering how mechanically disinclined most Redditors seems to be.\n\nI'll tell you this:  I spent a lot of my life with cars and motorcycles as a hobby.  I know a fair bit, I can perform a lot of repairs, and I can reasonably evaluate a used car.  But if you do to consider the opportunity cost of all that time, all the money into tools, books, magazines, hours spent learning by breaking things, and leaning when something's not worth salvaging anymore, I'd have been *far* better off buying a new, reliable car and driving it into the ground.\n\nIn particular, had I used new grad promotions to buy, say, a Camry, I'd be much better off financially at this point.  But I value the knowledge and the character of odd vehicles, so the trade-off is with it to me.

Here is what would have to be true in 2016 for them to claim you, in your situation.\n\nTo claim you as a dependent \"qualifying child\":\n\n* You are their child.\n* You were a student for at least part of 5 months in 2016 and under 24 on last day of 2016.\n* You lived with them more than half the year. Count time at school as living with them if you expect to move back (i.e. are only temporarily away for education purposes).\n* You did not pay more than half the cost of your support.\n* You are not married filing jointly. \n\nIn Publication 17, chapter 3, there is a Worksheet 3-1 that describes what counts as the cost of support. It involves lodging, food, utilities, medical, education expenses, and other things. \n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/uac/about-publication-17\n\nIf you did pay more than half the cost of your support in 2016, then they can't claim you as a dependent. Count loans as support provided by you; don't count scholarships and grants as support provided by you.\n\nSuppose they can't claim you as a qualifying child because you didn't live more than half the year with them. They might still be able to claim you as a \"qualifying relative\" if:\n\n* They provided more than half the cost of your support.\n\n* You did not have gross income more than $4050.\n\nIf you can be claimed as a dependent, and you are claimed as a dependent, then you don't get education tax credits but rather the tax filer who is claiming you might be able to. In that case, share your 1098-T form with your parents, in case they are able to get a tax credit based on education expenses not covered by tax-free assistance. \n\nIf you can be claimed as a dependent but your parents choose not to claim an exemption for you, then it's possible for you to get AOTC tax credit based on adjusted qualified education expenses if you have any, as long as the AOTC has not been claimed four years. See IRS Publication 970.\n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/uac/about-publication-970\n\n>you can file as a student and receive somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,000 one time\n\nI don't know what this is referring to precisely. Students who are eligible for AOTC might be eligible for a refundable portion of credit that gives money even if their tax has already been reduced to zero, but there are special criteria that have to be met for this to happen, related to how much earned income you have in relation to the cost of your support. You can read about that refundable portion in Pub 970. It's irrelevant if your exemption is being claimed as a dependent by your parents. You should get them done at HR Block or someplace and at least that way there's a guarantee if anything gets messed up. Ask your parents not to claim you as well. If they do end up claiming you and you file by yourself, well. That's fraud.

A better way to do it would just be have your work automatically direct deposit a set amount of your paycheck into a separate account.

I really liked the app and it saved a good amount over the couple months that I used it. They say you won't miss the money, and I really didn't. They move small amounts every couple days based on an analysis of your spending habits and recurring bills. Only reason I stopped using it is because I switched banks and my new bank isn't supported.

I've read a lot of advice indicating that, after meeting your employer's match on a 401k, you should switch to investing in an IRA. The recommendation continues that, only after you max your annual IRA contribution, should you switch back to putting money into your 401k. \n\nI've seen this advice all over the place, but I haven't seen much by way of explaining it. The only justification I've seen is that you get more investment options from an IRA. My 401k has pretty great investment options, and I'm satisfied with the rate of return. Is there another reason that should I switch to an IRA before contributing more than employer match to my 401k?\n\nThanks! I had surgery on 12/19/16. An injury earlier in the year meant I'd already hit my deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. My anesthesiologist billed my insurance on 12/22/16 and I owed nothing. My surgeon didn't bill until 1/3/17, which my insurance treated as a 2017 expense for which I owe several hundred dollars. Is there something I can do to correct this? Do I need to argue with my insurance company or the surgeon?  Got a new job and a new 401K. What do I do with the 401K from my old employer? The amount in my old 401k is <$10k This year I'll make too much to contribute to a Roth IRA. I want to do the backdoor Roth, and as I understand it, I do it like so:\n\n1. Start a traditional IRA at the bank of my choosing (Vanguard)\n2. Contribute $5,500 of my paycheck (already-taxed money) to the IRA\n3. Before the end of the year (April 15 next year?) rollover traditional IRA into Roth IRA\n4. When I do taxes for the year, don't claim the deduction for the traditional\n\nIs that the gist of it? Anything I'm missing? If I'm making extra payments each month on my student loans, does the timing of the extra payment matter? What actions can be taken if you do not receive your W2s in the allotted time? I know the place I had worked last year didn't send out the W2s until well into February, but I thought that the laws stated they must be sent out by Jan 31st?  Quick thank you to PF for helping me get everything under control. I have a plan for paying off my debts and to save. I've also gotten a promotion/pay raise in the last few months that obviously helps. My monthly income is now more than my expenses. Before I was breaking even, living paycheck to paycheck (like sometimes having $5 in my account). \n\nSo.. My dumb question. Now that I have a few hundred in my account that isn't designated towards savings, debt, or living expenses; what do I do with it? Should I just put it in savings? Or put it towards debt? Do I need to readjust my plan? Or do I just let a couple hundred sit in my account as a cushion?\n\nAfter living sooo long with just a couple bucks after expenses, I'm at a loss and feel dumb for not knowing what to do. [deleted] The amount of social security tax taken from my bi-monthly paycheck has increased from $200 to $292. This seems like a very large increase and I'm not sure why. I am salaried at $114000 annually. Can anyone explain the increase?  I'm looking for a good personal finance tracking excel spreadsheet. \n\nIs there a consensus best one on this sub? Or any you'd personally recommend? What I use is pretty basic, looking to beef it up.  My husband and I took a look at our finances yesterday and are thinking about switching the approach to our debts. I would love for all these debts to be finished by January 2021.\n\nI was hoping I could get some insight on if this makes sense. \n\nWe have: \n\n23500 of student loan debt with Earnest with a 4.48% variable APR, it seems to be rising by .01 every month. \n\n4500 of student loan debt with Nelnet at 3.5% fixed APR\n\n4800 of auto loan debt with 5.45% fixed APR (Loan is supposed to end 9-2019)\n\nCurrently we pay $330 to Earnest, $55 to Nelnet, and $146 to the car. I make an extra payment of $220 a month to Earnest. According to [running the numbers on What's The Cost](http://i.imgur.com/AzC80KM.png), if we switch the extra $220 a month to the car loan, we'll pay it off by March 2018. We can then apply that money to the Earnest loan. I just feel like I was making good headway on the Earnest loan and feel a little reluctant to switch. Thoughts? Why isn't MA open for state taxes in credit karma yet? If I make a 2016 Roth IRA contribution next week, will the Saver's Credit still apply to that contribution? I'm 30.

Given my situation should I jsut put the 20% into 401K until it is maxed out, or should I only go the 6-10% route in 401K and the rest in a Roth?

Request was approved with no hassle but they gave me 10,000 limit.\n\nI'm not particularly worried about the limit, but I have no need for a 10k limit when I plan to pay off the credit card as I use it (assuming I even get that high), so I requested a decrease in limit to 5,000.\n\nChecked online, and as requested, my *credit* limit remains at 10,000 but I have an *available* limit of 5,000. I know what available limit means, but I thought I was requesting that the credit limit be decreased.\n\nHere's my question: does this really affect me any? I don't want to have a card balance > 5000$ and lowering my available limit to 5k will ensure this doesn't happen. However having 10k limit for an once-a-year vacation credit card might mess with my availability to get cdn currency credit, no? Should I call them up to decrease the actual credit limit?\n\n(I have excellent credit rating otherwise) Should I include my minimum monthly student loan payments in the monthly expenses I use to calculate my emergency fund? it doubles the amount I need (therefore doubles the amount of time I need to save up for a solid fund before starting to aggressively pay loans), but in a true income emergency I could apply for forbearance, so I may not need the value of monthly payments. What do other people do?  Can you put too much into retirement?\n\nI got my first job. I have an emergency fund, but is it too much to max out IRA, 401k, and HSA if after that, I only will have a little bit left over after all of my living expenses. \n\nI don't have any foreseeable big purchases in the future, but is it ever better just to match 401k, then put the rest of the money in a taxable account in case I needed it before retirement? If I have separate backdoor Roth iras each year as I convert, will that give me less compounding interest power vs a traditional Ira and bundling the same money together?  I know that you can withdraw Roth IRA contributions after 5 years without penalty. But what if I rollover a Roth 401k? Am I allowed to withdraw contributions early? I'm 19, looking to build a dividend-growth portfolio, should I focus on growing companies like Visa ($V) who are still growing and increasing dividends or buy steady companies like $SO? Time frame: 30-40 years I have a well funded emergency fund, which is probably too much at this point with the stability of my employment. I still contribute to my HSA which is included in this bucket as my health is generally good. What this means is that my EFund is still growing, even though it really doesn't need to. \n\nFirst: Should I even be counting the HSA as \"Emergency fund\"? It has enough to cover my deductible plus some. I have plenty of cash to cover my out of pocket maximums in the other Efund accounts. \n\nSecond: If I do count the HSA, should I skim off the top of the standard savings account and put it in a general investment account? This could be used as the last ditch Efund, or possibly long term savings. I would still have plenty in Cash+HSA to cover 6months expenses. This skim would just be in the market rather than a savings account. [deleted] [deleted] While prepping for my 2016 taxes I noticed a potential error in the 2015 taxes that were since approved and I got a refund for. It was never flagged or caught and is relatively small, but it works in my favor. Basically my then employer at the time left off the amount I did with dependent care from my W2.\n\nWhat's the best course of action here? File 2016 as normal and then go in and refile/amend 2015 after? Leave it? \n\nWhat's the likelihood of it being noticed given it was for 2015? \n(Disclaimer: I'm not saying I'm going to ignore it ever happened, but now I have seen it, I don't want to be on the wrong side of the IRS and would want to correct it as soon as possible, but I'm curious if I didn't amend that years return immediately if they'd pick it up in a random review like a year from now or something.) I filed my taxes and received almost $3k back in refunds between federal and state level. So now I'm interested in lowering (upping?) my witholding so I get more of that money back each paycheck and don't end up owing taxes at the end of the year. On the W4 form, is allowances the same as witholding or the thing I want to increase from 0 to 1?\n\n\nI intend to review the difference, calculate it out, and just add the delta to a high yield savings account so in the invent I do somehow owe for 2017, I should have it covered. I might even increase to 2 since I think I qualify for that based on the W4 (single, independent, no dependents, one job) Is there any benefit in doing taxes sooner rather than later?   Hello everyone,\nI am seeking advice on handling an army rotc scholarship debt. My account was closed in 2012 and is now marked as a delinquent/charge off account. I am now in a position of being able to actually pay the balance of around $6,000, but I'm confused on the best way to handle this with concerns to my credit. My credit score has been stuck in the same spot for quite sometime and it is obvious that this debt is the issue. If I pay it now will my credit be ruined for seven years or is it possible to pay the balance and have it removed by credit agencies. I feel lost in this and want to find the best solution. Any help is appreciated and thanks in advance! What's the best option for my credit, I am paying off a auto loan and I am wondering is it better to put more money in each month and pay it off faster or to pay the minimum.  My Girlfriend and I have decided to get serious about our finances and establish a savings plan. We come in to it with $0 in emergency savings, $12,000 in credit card debt, and both with sub-600 credit scores. \n\nMy goals are, of course, to increase the savings, lower the debt, and increase the credit score (weighed down by a combo of high credit utilization and missed payments). I want to increase our credit scores quickly because we want to get a better apartment later this year when our lease is up.\n\nWe currently have $400 a month leftover after bills, with groceries and gas estimated in there as well. We've scaled back our bills as much as possible in our situation. I looked around and found that the credit union offered by my job has the best interest rate I can get on savings (1.25 APY) and the money comes directly out of my check before it gets deposited into my bank. Win-win there. I currently save $100/month this way and will likely go up to 200 or 300. 3 months of emergency savings for us would be $7200.\n\nWe're about to come into 2 small windfalls, my income tax return and her college refund check, both above $1000. My question is should I use that money as the seed to start our emergency savings, should I use it all on the credit card debt to lessen the strain on our credit scores, or should we split it so we get a starting point for the emergency savings and knock something off our debt?

Question about student loan consolidation. I have a pair of loans from Wells Fargo, at ~9 and 10%. When I logged in to make my monthly payment yesterday, I got an auto-prompt about a consolidation loan. Sure, why not? The interest rate might be lower and save me money. So I applied.\n\nToday I got a call: Need a co-signer, because my debt-to-income ratio is too high. I can understand having too high a ratio to take out a new loan, but why is this a problem when I am not incurring any additional debt? The consolidation would just directly pay old debt and end up reducing my monthly payment, overall making my finances in better shape. Why does my debt-to-income ratio matter for a consolidation loan, and is there anything I can do to get around it (aside from a cosigner)? Any good place to start researching to pick a primary bank to do business with?

How best can I weigh the pros and cons of choosing between a 529 savings plan and purchasing tuition credits? I'm in TX (and realize I can set up 529 in any state). As of a couple months ago I had zero credit and so I signed up for a secured credit card. I fronted the money to max out the limit ($2500) for the card, but had to pay it off early last month because of the holidays - gifts, planning travel, etc. - and I was close to maxing out the card. According to NerdWallet, my credit score is now 640.\n\nThe problem is that a $2500 limit is not enough to cover my expenses over the course of a couple months (the time between the current statement and next due date). Money isn't really an issue, but it's a pain to have to manually pay off the full bill weeks before the due date, just so I can continue using the card / building credit.\n\n**TL;DR: Would it be worthwhile to apply for a second secured credit card?** Would that speed up building credit? Or should I just suck it up and manually pay my credit card bill manually? Or are there other options?\n\nOn a related note, I'd like to apply for several regular credit cards and increase my limit - what's a baseline score that will get me a card with a usable limit? Receipts usually have the last four digits of the cc, plus an approval number and a transaction number. is there any danger of identity theft related issues if someone gets a hold of one of my receipts with that info on it?\n\nCould they call the store and give the transaction number and get any information about me?\n I currently have $2500 in a Vanguard Federal Money Market Fund. I'd like to move that $2500 into a 2055 Target Retirement Fund, but I don't know how to transfer from one fund to the other. \n\nAny help is appreciated\n\nEDIT: Figured out the exchange, thank you guys I have a $500 limit 'student' credit card that I opened in college through my university's credit union and don't use anymore for anything substantial(just enough to keep it active). It's my oldest card, ~4 years old now, and I only have one other I opened this past summer($5k limit starting, already upped 1k because of good behavior). I don't want to close my student card and don't plan on using it, but I'm wondering if it would be beneficial to request a better limit now that I'm not a student, have a good income, and great credit. I think my CC utilization is generally between 10-15% so I don't know if it would really make a difference. I'm still young and figuring this all out though, any advice/info would be appreciated! I currently have a Parent PLUS student loan in my mom's name for $6700 which I am slowly chipping away at. The interest rate is 7.2%. I recently got the idea to take out a Subsidized loan to refinance, so to speak. Is this legal? Is there any downside to this? \n\nBy my estimate this would have 2 benefits: I would save roughly $400 in interest this year and the payments I'm making would show up on my credit instead of my mom's. Any advice? \n So stupid question, I filed for an extension last year and then never ended up filing. I know I don't owe money, but how would I go about getting last year's information filed, and hopefully, get my return? I usually use turbo tax if that matters.\n\nThanks! 30 y/o. Needing advice on moving funds around. (Apologies as this is sort of a stock question/personal finance question).\n\nI'm currently in an employee stock plan through work (8% bi-weekly). Over the past 10 years, I've amassed a little over 70k (after cashing out about 10k last year) and have been feeling weird about keeping it all in on one single stock. Lately, I've been considering cashing out around half of this amount, but I don't know exactly what to do with the funds.  \n\nShould these be placed in a Vanguard account? If so, what kind? Should I invest in other companies? Should I open a ROTH IRA and place it all in there?  \n\nSavings:  \n- 401k through work is a little over 82k. (14% bi-weekly contribution w/company matching 6%).  \n- Savings at 17k.  \n- Cars paid off.  \n\nCurrent debts:  \n- 127k home loan.  \n\nUpcoming debts:  \n- Home/plumbing work (10k estimated).  \n- Possible engagement.  \n\nReasons for saving: Future; wedding, kids, college, retirement. I'm currently in the process of paying down my credit card debt. Luckily it's a not a huge amount (I hate that it exists at all but that's another story), about $5,050. I have a tax refund of $1715 coming, as well as $450 in work reimbursement for a recent trip (the costs I incurred are included on the card amount). I should have the entire balanced paid down by late April. \n\nAt that point, I need to shift my focus to an emergency fund but I have a 401 question. I currently contribute the amount my company matches (6%). I'd like to raise that (I only make $40k) but am unsure of whether I should raise it first or throw that extra money towards the emergency fund first. I'd like to ultimately have a $10k emergency fund but that's going to take me some time. \n\nDoes it make sense (post clearing out this debt) to save maybe $1k in the emergency fund and raise my % going to my IRA, slowing down the speed at which I can amass the $10k? Or get myself to the $10k then worry about raising my 401k contribution? I'm about to turn 29, for the record.  Best cheap tax software? I have light investing so not sure if that changes  How do I determine what my interest rate might be when financing a used car? I see current rates, but I assume those are for people with perfect scores? I have \"good\" credit and a score around 700 on average, do I guess 5%, 10%, 15%? I can't imagine it would be over 15% or under 5% unless I had perfect credit right?  Anyone have any experience with railroad retirement taxes?  I noticed my 401k contributions arent deducted before my RRT taxes are figured. Is this normal?  I thought 401k was pretax or is that just for federal and state? My sister is a freshman in college and I've already paid for both semesters. After loans and grants, I paid about $3,000 a semester. For her remaining 3 years I'll likely do the same, but I'd like to get some tax advantages from a 529 if I can. Based on my understanding, I can open up an investment 529 and avoid taxes on that $6,000. Is that true? If so, can I \"invest\" in something incredibly stable like bonds? I looked at Vanguard's 529 page and that's likely who I'd open it with. Ok, I just made a contribution to my 2017 Roth IRA in vanguard and for some reason, it wouldn't let me do the exact amount of $5500 that I transferred from my Bank, only $5,499.99. So now I'm left with $0.01 in my Federal money market settlement account. Did I do something wrong? My OCD can't handle that $0.01 in there...is there anything I can do to get rid of it? Thanks guys!! Tax Related;\n\nI'm 23, single. Switched jobs halfway through 2016. \nJob A I have 24k income from, Job B I have 13k income. Using Taxact, it showed a refund on Job A or Job B but once both are together, it shows I owe $1400 State/Federal. Is there a reason for this? I can provide more details as needed.

Do I need to carry my health/dental insurance cards with me, or could I just keep a picture on my phone for the carrier and group number?

We both have the same exact salary per year and both work in the same county/school district.\n\nWe got our W2's back this week so I started entering in all the info (I used both TurboTax and Credit Karma).\n\nI entered mine first and was told I was owed $600+ ($400~ in federal, $200~ in state). Cool!\n\nI entered my husband's second and all of a sudden, now *we* owe $2,000.\n\nShould we go to a tax professional for this? We have insanely simple taxes. Just two W2's (I also had to enter a 1099G and a 1095A from a brief period of unemployment where I was compensated and also was on a healthcare.gov medical plan.)\n\nI'm not completely sure what went wrong. It seems like all of the appropriate taxes got taken out of his account, but we owe two grand??\n\nHas anyone else gone through something like this who can offer some insight? [removed] There's a flowchart knocking about that has a step titled increase emergency fund to 3-6 months living expenses.\nI'm currently living with my parents rent free, so my living expenses are quite low.

I'm rather eager to move about \u00a33,500 into my ~4% ISA if i don't need it easily accessible I know that r/pf hates combining insurance with investments because you get a poor return on your investment and you are insured longer than you need.

I'm no expert but I read the fine print and checked the numbers and it all seems legit to me. What am I missing? My wife and I are planning to build our new house on a lot we own. I'm wanting to keep the price of the new house low enough so that after we sell our existing house, we'll be able to own the new house free and clear in 5 years. My wife is against this idea since she thinks it would be better for us to have the tax break of a traditional 15-30 year mortgage. Can someone please explain to me which is the better approach?  Traditional IRA Question\n\nI'm currently working at a job with no retirement plan (401k or otherwise). I know that means there is no income limitation on who can contribute to a traditional IRA and deduct it from their taxes. However, I'm moving in August, and my new job will have a 401k available. So, two questions (for when I'll file next year):\n\n1. Because I'll eventually work at a job this year with a 401k, am I subject to the income limit for deductions?\n\n2. If yes, then is that income limit my 2017 AGI or what?\n\nI want to start contributing to an IRA but my ability to deduct a traditional IRA from my income is a huge factor in whether I do traditional or Roth.  My employer matches 100% of the first 1% that I contribute to my 401k and 50% of the next 2-5%. \n\nDoes this mean I need to contribute 5% to take advantage of their full matching potential and anything over 5% is not matched?  As this sub focuses on the US, is there a list of sibling-subs for personal finance in other countries? Especially a sub for Germany would be interesting to me. If you use a credit card and pay it off immediately, will that activity register and keep it open? My oldest card is about 15 years old, and I only keep it to maintain a good average age of credit. Once or twice a year I'll buy a cup of coffee with it to keep it from closing from lack of activity - if I immediately pay off the balance will that activity keep it from closing, or do I need to let it go through a billing cycle to register?  I have a car loan that I have been paying ahead of schedule. I could pay it off in another couple months. The loan has another 2.5ish years on it though I think. Is it worth me leaving a small amount on the loan in order to help my credit score? Currently about 710. Could leave about $50 and let it accrue for a year or two with 3% interest and pay just over $3 Is 0.19% a good expense ratio for a 2055 target fund? Thank you. Can I contribute money earned in previous years to a Roth IRA? Also, can I contribute money I haven't earned yet but expect to this year? Someone told me that if you have a poor credit score and you want to get a mortgage, that manual underwriting doesn't use a credit score.  I've never heard of that, but can't speak intelligently on the topic.  Did the person tell me the truth or was she wrong? Have a question about qualifying for a mortgage.\n\nI'm a computer programmer that recently changed from a permanent, full-time position to \"contract\" work. In the tech context \"contract\" means I'm still a W2 employee, but it's hourly pay and mutually understood that my position is temporary.\n\nSo, I'm not filing as a 1099 and will have plenty of income to qualify. But my current position is explicitly a temporary position and I'm unclear if anyone verifying my employment would be told as much. \n\nIn the past I've moved back and forth between perm and contract positions, but I definitely don't have two years of just contract work to show tax returns on. Any thoughts on if I'll have problems qualifying for a mortgage and if so how to approach it? Asked this elsewhere in the thread, but is there anything wrong with putting my company 401(k) into a target date fund and putting my personal IRA into the same target date fund? It feels \"undiversified\" but I know the fund itself is diversified, and with the traditional 401(k) and Roth IRA I will also be diversifying myself from a tax perspective.\n\nI guess all I'm asking is, after a number of years, if I have 100k, 200k+ all in the target 2055 fund, should I be diversifying more? If I made $11 in capital gains do I even need to give it to my accountant? Will anyone ever find out about it. This is for my Schwab brokerage accounts which now has $0 in it. What happens if I don't report it? I have finished my taxes for 2017 and my federal and state returns have been approved through turbotax. I recently have received a 1099-R form in the mail and do not know what the next steps are. Do file this personally or send to someone else for documentation? I think it has to do with a retirement plan transfer for my current company. If there was a section on turbo tax to input this information, as i said before, i would have missed it because I already filed and received my return. I am quite new at this and any information on how to proceed would be greatly appreciated concerning this form.

", "title": "18 years old and I need help with my tax returns but I have no idea where to start", "comments": ">  My mom says that she has to file it with her taxes because I am dependent and live with her. Is this true?\n\nNo. You can file on your own. You just make sure you don't claim yourself. **claiming a dependent and being a dependent**\n\nYou will still fill out your own tax filing and send it in. It's actually not right for your mother to file your taxes, because you have to sign your own form.\n\nYour mother is still able to claim you as a dependent. What this means is that she gets to deduct 4050 from her income (in addition to a standard deduction amount appropriate for her filing status), before she calculates her income tax. \n\nFor you, when you file you'll indicate that you can be claimed as a dependent. The upshot for you as a Single filer is that you get to subtract 6300 standard deduction that won't be taxed (if you earned more than 6300), but you don't get to also subtract 4050. It's only the income over 6300 that gets taxed.\n\n**gross income and taxable income**\n\nYou'll add the W-2 box 1 amounts to get your total wages from your two jobs. You subtract your deduction amount to find your taxable income.\n\nIf your income from your two jobs adds up to 8400, for example, your taxable income is 8400 \u2013 6300 = 2100.\n\nThe first 9275 of taxable income is taxed at 10%, so your tax would be about 210. \n\nThe tax table in the instructions for the tax form you use will give you the exact value to use, when you look up 2100 in it. Everyone with taxable income in the range 2100-2125 is treated as if their taxable income is 2112.50, and 10% of that rounds to 211, so the tax is actually 211.\n\n**withheld tax \u2013 actual tax = refund**\n\nYou'll add the W-2 box 2 amounts to get the total amount of federal income tax that was taken from your paychecks. \n\nIn the above example, suppose 257 was your total withholding. Since your actual tax is only 211, you would have overpaid, so you'd get 46 back as a refund.\n\nIt is possible that your withholding is more than your tax, which is why it's good to file. Even if you don't technically have a requirement to file (if you earned under 6300 and had no other income), you should file if you would get a refund of federal income tax. If you don't file, you don't get your refund sent to you.\n\n**special details**\n\nIf you earned under 6300 total, you have to fill out a mini worksheet to learn what your deduction amount is. See back page of 1040EZ form. It is a number between 1050 and 6300, and likely would be your wages + 350. In that case, it's a number bigger than your wages, so if you subtract it you'd get a negative number. In that case, you write 0 for taxable income and 0 for income tax. Any federal income tax that was withheld would be returned to you as a refund.\n\nYour W-2s will also show how much tax got sent to support Social Security and Medicare. Those taxes don't get returned to you. It's only the federal income tax withholding that might have a discrepancy, because withholding of income tax isn't an exact science; sometimes too much is taken, sometimes too little, and tax filing is the way to square things up.\n\nIf you can be claimed as a dependent, and you are claimed as a dependent, then there aren't a lot of other things to do on your tax form. Most tax deductions and tax credits are not available to dependents. Also, you leave the line about health care coverage blank and do not even check off \"full-year coverage\" box, if you are a dependent. That gets taken care of on the tax filing of whoever is claiming you as a dependent.\n\n**which form to use?**\n\nForm 1040EZ might be the form you can use. Download it and its instructions from irs.gov. \n\nhttps://www.irs.gov/uac/about-form-1040ez\n\nYou can mail it in, attaching the two federal portions torn off from your W-2, or you can find a free e-filing software to use at www.irs.gov/freefile.\n\nYour refund will come as a check made out to you, not your mother. If you have a bank account, you can supply bank account info to have a refund direct deposited instead.

Old enough that the cost of the car and insurance is low. \n\nNot sure why people thing cars will suddenly fall apart after the warranty runs out. The best way is to do all manufacture recommended service intervals and fix things when they start to give issues. Most break down come with lots of warnings. I do this and never actually had a break down. Cars lose most of their value within 2 years. (Basically once you drive It off the lot) the cheapest method is to \"run it into the ground\" and buy one that's about 1-2 years old. Well kept cars this young don't normally have problems and have lost significant value.  Run it into the ground. If you can get to the point you have no payments, put money away like you're making payments. Then when your car shits the bed you'll have enough to pay off most of of not all of another. Repeat. >My father in-law is always telling me to trade up before my car loses value. He said that's the smartest way and leads to lower total cost of ownership.\n\nCars typically depreciate the most both in nominal dollars and %s when you buy them. Typically the cost of depreciation will slowly decrease as a car ages.\n\nSo, if your FIL is correct you need to trade up before buying a car since the most significant hit is after buying a new car and in the years shortly following.\n\nThis is why many people buy older cars, a basic reliable car that is 3-5 years old will have decreased in value a much greater percentage than it has declined in useful life. trading a car in to a dealer is ALWAYS a losing proposition. I average 200,000 miles and at least 10 years on every vehicle I have ever owned....I had as many as 325,000 miles on 1985 Madza 626 I bought new in 1985 (sold in 1995) with no significant issues.... 225,000mi on 1994 ford ranger I got rid of in 2016.......my cost of ownership is a low as you can have....every month I don't have a car payment is a month that money is saved or used on something else Having a car payment in perpetuity, even if reduced due to a trade in, is always a losing proposition.  That plan doesn't make any mathematical sense. Car value is exponential decrease. What your father-in-law is recommending is that when your car FINALLY stops depreciating so fast, to trade it in so that someone like me can buy it for pennies on the dollar. Your father-in-law's plan would only make sense if he bought a car that doesn't depreciate, or using his logic, you would have to trade it in before you buy it.\n\nThe best plan is to buy something 4-7 years old, that has depreciated to less than half of its original MSRP. Drive it for 10-15 years, and a small repair here or there is FAR offset by the savings of not having a car payment for the rest of your life, subsidizing depreciation, and the full coverage insurance required on a financed car.

I picked the 7 over the 5 because you can always throw money towards it whenever you have it spare, where you are forced to pay what the loan asks with the 3 or 5 year loan. \n\nWent to more than one place and kept asking them to print off the grand total \"because i have a couple more cars to see\". You then take that paper with the total of the car elsewhere and all of a sudden the next dealership will have a magical deal or discount for you. If you are going for a sedan or a coupe, stick with the sedan or coupe, as the prices are usually similar.\n\nAnyway, I managed to get a $28.5k car for $25k, with 0% on the loan doing this. If you feel nervous, ask a parent or a friend who knows anything about cars/loans etc. to come along with you and make sure you are getting a good deal.\n I would advise against buying new. As those will be the most expensive and depreciate the fastest. Buy used. Car loans should be based off very simple criteria. It's basic math really. Car value and APR.\n\n20k car @ 10% interest over 6 years is 200 a month.\n\nThe actual purchasing of the car and making sure you get a \"good deal\" can be tricky. I've never met someone who didn't think they got a good deal from the dealership. The reality is vehicles are just like any other retail product. There is a value that it took to make the product, a value the product is sold to the vendor, and a value the vendor deems enough to guarantee profitability and overhead.\n\nNo business is going to sell a product for less than what they paid for it unless that product is bad and/or is getting reimbursed from the manufacturer for the lost profits.\n\nNegotiations for a vehicle come from knowing what they bought the car for, which most used car dealerships won't tell you. So you just have to compare their sticker price to others. This can take time and be annoying to deal with. Sales people at dealerships are usually paid on a percentage commission of the profit. So they are wanting to keep the price high. The only dealership that I know of that doesn't pay their sales people this way is CarMax.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nSource: I am a professional car buyer and appraiser [deleted] ", "date": 1483257600.0, "upvotes": 1, "flair": "Advice for buying my first car in the US?"}{"body": "Long story short, college didn't work out, went 3.5k into debt to figure that out.

Let the finance company repossess your car. \n\nNumber 3 is likely not an option as your credit is bad and you have negative equity. Number 4 is a last resort as it will ruin your credit even more and if they pursue you in court they could get a judgment for the difference between the loan and the auction price of the car minus the auction costs (i.e. much larger than the negative equity amount). \n\nOptions 1 and 2 are the best choices. If you have a high interest rate and another car, option 2 is the best. The problem with option 2 is it requires you to front the money for the negative equity. You can't sell the car without paying off the loan. Option 1 is not great, but better than 3 and 4 in most situations. \n\nUnfortunately, if you are stuck with more car than you can afford, have bad credit, and negative equity, the options available are not great. If you want advice on how to pick the best option for you we need more details about the loans and your cash on hand.

The best option would be to thoroughly go over your budget and make the necessary adjustments so that you can make your monthly payment.  Then keep making that payment until you're no longer underwater then sell the vehicle and buy one you can afford. There is no \"least amount of damage.\" If you don't pay this off, your car will be repo-ed, and you will be screwed for another 7 years. You need to make the payments on-time.

Her loans are currently \u201con pause\u201d in that payments aren\u2019t required until 2019, but interest is accruing (but not compounding) until that 2019 date, at which point the monthly payment will be ~$3.2k.\n\nSo my question is this: How do I tackle this massive load of debt? Once we get married I want to liquidate my brokerage account and put that $117k against the loans, but that still leaves a $123k mountain to climb. Also, I\u2019m not sure what the tax ramifications are of liquidating that much money. Other Questions: Do I sell my house and put my equity against the loan amount, or do I keep it rented out and use the profit from the rent to pay down the loan? If I keep it rented out, do I refi to a 15 yr or 30 yr fixed? And do I keep it for just the next 3 years so I don\u2019t have to pay taxes on capital gains when I sell it, or do I just commit to holding it as an investment property for the next 40 years? Also, do I try to refi her debt? If I do, I lose that \u201cpause\u201d so I\u2019ll have to start making payments monthly right away, which I basically plan to do anyways but it\u2019s nice to not have it be compulsory until 2019 in case other things come up (plus my salary is HIGHLY variable from month to month). Or is there another option I haven\u2019t thought of? I know you folks are smart here, and I apologize for the novel, but I\u2019m hopeful you can offer some insight and guidance!

You bought a house on an ARM when rates were at historic lows.  Where do you think rates are going to go from there?  Where do you think that rates will be in 4 years' time?  This needs to be refinanced into a fixed mortgage beyond ASAP.  I wouldn't wait the 4 years to find out that rates are 1.5% higher than they are now and you can no longer afford the home.\n\n>at which point it\u2019ll hopefully be more like $80k-$100k/yr.\n\nShe went into $240k of student loan debt.....to get a career that pays around $90,000 a year?  Does she understand that nearly a third of her take home salary will be consumed by interest alone?  What's her strategy to address this?\n\n>But right around then she wants to start a family so she\u2019d probably only be working about part time for the following 5 years.\n\nOh my god.  She went $240k into student loan debt....for a $90k job....that she doesn't even want to work.  Her strategy is to work part time (an option which may not even be available) while allowing her skills to degrade and her contacts to grow stale for a substantial period of time?  If this is seriously her plan, she should stop school immediately.  She should pursue Teach for America in your area, pursue the 5 year student loan forgiveness options for teachers, and you should throw your taxable brokerage amount and surplus funds from the rental house at her existing student loan debt.  Her continuing to spend money on a degree she's going to make useless isn't worth anything.  \n\n>Do I sell my house and put my equity against the loan amount\n\nI'd liquidate it *if* you couldn't refinance it for a reasonable rate of money. It looks like the rents are north of 1% of your purchase price.  Assuming your tenants aren't horrid, this isn't a bad investment.  I wouldn't refinance to a 15 year, since you need cash flow.\n\nI think she needs to want to be out of debt a bit more than she currently does.  She's looking at a real crisis here and waived her right to slam the partial retirement button at 35 by consuming years of income in debt.  This isn't impossible for you to bail her out of, but fully appreciate that the enormity of the mistake will be lost if you waive a wand and disappear the debt. If you are living in a free apartment with no other debts other than $300k debt (not counting your current home because your profiting off that mortgage) and making $175k-$200k I would just live as mediocre as possible for 18-24 months and pay off the debt. If you can't do it then she should consider working a full year $80k+ salary then begin your extended family. You don't want to have debt looming over your head as you have a new addition in your lives.\n\nJust think in 4 years you'll have a paid off house, no debt, and a new child....and then your on the path to building personal wealth like crazy.  The info you provided about your fianc\u00e9e makes me believe she is on path to become a therapist. If it is indeed true, I highly recommend looking into 80-100K closer. This income implies good client base which fresh graduate may not have.  Not too much to say, but I think the answer on refinancing is to apply and see what you can get. Applying for a refinance doesn't mean you have to accept it.\n\nAlso, if you're going to get absolutely free rent plus make $1k off your current property, then you'll be in a great shape to just take on that debt \"the normal\" way after paying it down with the brokerage account.\n\nNot really my business, but seems like if your SO is spending so long getting an advanced degree that they would want to stop pursuing their career for much more than several months to start a family. There are probably solutions (family and babysitters/nannies come to mind) that allow your SO to work and be a parent. I really don't mean to sound horrible, but are you marrying the right person? \nBy the description of it,  it sounds like your partner's still got a kid mentality,  just doing things for the sake of. \n\nWho,  in his right mind, would take a 240k debt on their shoulders to make 90k a year and then go part time basically just after? \n\nThey way you've described it sounds like you're paying someone almost 300k to early retire at the age of 35.\n\nI mean,  to me marriage is about equality. \nThis is not equal. This is a bargain for her,  and a financial massacre for you. \n\nI know love is love, but this looks like the perfect scenario for a marriage ending in  a disaster. \n\nJust my 2 cents I'd remortgage the house for funds against student loan and keep the investments. Sounds like you're doing well, you'll figure it out. You have really no bills(since your mortgage is basically taken care of) and make 150k. If you don't mind paying her debt I don't see the issue. Since you live basically rent free and have no student loans. You should have at least 5k a month to throw at her debt right now. Throw 5k to it a month starting now. You could pay off 60k this year alone. Also wait on the kids. She didn't go to school and get that much debt to not work full time. That's just stupid. Wait until she is making 80-100k a year have a kid and put them in daycare. Also will this new apartment be big enough for kids? If not think of that. And I would refinance your mortgage since it's a arm and the rates will increase. Good luck.

I would say \n0) Learn fast and invest in yourself while you are young. Set yourself up for growth. That will lead to better pay. \n1) Cook at home more often\n2) Recurring expenses (internet, phone, cable, insurance, gym) adds up.

The story you're referring to is an old wive's tale, for lack of a better phrase, where people misunderstand how tax brackets work.\n\nFor benefits purposes (food stamps, ACA assistance, etc.), there is a kernel of truth to this. Look up \"entitlements cliff\" or \"benefits cliff\" for more information. No.   \n\nThey might lose some income-related benefits (e.g. ACA premium support) if they cross certain breakpoints, but they wouldn't pay more in federal income taxes per se.  Nope, that's not how income tax brackets work. In almost every case that ever exists no.  Only the money over a certain threshold is taxed at the higher rate.\n\nNo if you get some kinds of government assistance, a raise could make you ineligible for those. Except in unusual circumstances with particular credits, no this isn't possible. Tax brackets only affect the income within that range not one's entire income. Surprisingly common misconception. Never. You'll taxed more at the margin (so the difference between the threshold of te upper limit of your old tax bracket and your new tax bracket). You won't have less money by making more and being in a higher bracket than if you had earned less. \n\nThat's a common misconception about taxes but that's not how they work. From http://blog.taxact.com/how-tax-brackets-work/: \n\n\"Your marginal tax rate, according to the Federal Income Tax Brackets chart below, is 10%. You pay $900 in income tax. That\u2019s simple.\n\nWhat if your taxable income is $19,000?\n\nAs a Single filer, you\u2019re now in the 15% tax bracket. That doesn\u2019t mean you pay 15% on all your income, however.\n\nYou pay 10% on the first $9,225, plus 15% of the amount over $9,225.\" Income taxes don't work that way. It's possible that some incentive programs like welfare, social security, or ACA subsidies do have a benefit cliff. \n\nIn fact, I'm sure that ACA subsidies do have a cliff. If your raise is not enough to make up for the loss in subsidy then it might make sense to pass on a raise. But it might be short-sighted if you lock yourself into a stagnant income versus taking raises that eventually more than make up for the temporary shortfall. \n\nAs others point out it's very common for people to pass on a promotion that changes you from hourly (with overtime) to salary (without overtime).

Typically, when one has multiple jobs, the formula doesn't withhold quite enough to pay the taxes owed.\n\nYou have no problem.  You don't need to go to work and complain.  Pay the $60 more that you owe and go on with your life. It sounds like everything is working out perfect for you. You had taxes withheld during the year, and now you only owe a very small amount.\n\n***This is the ideal situation. What are you concerned about?*** Having taxes withheld is a legal requirement for anyone with an expected tax liability in the US. You should have been given a w-4 to fill out yourself when you started work, but you may just be forgetting this happening.\n\nThe fact you owe more when you do your tax return in fact indicates you're not having enough withheld, though if it's only $60, that's about as close to spot-on withholding as you're going to get.\n\nYou can't have your w-2 \"revised\" unless the information is inaccurate, which is unlikely. And unless your goal is to be paid less now, have the IRS hold on to your money, and give you a refund later, you probably don't want to mess with the w-4, which controls your withholding, either. > The only issue is that I NEVER REQUESTED FOR THIS TO BE DONE. What can I do to reverse this?\n\nThe reason you *only* owe $60 is because you had federal tax withheld. You worked two jobs over the past year, right? At two separate companies? \n\nThose companies don't know that you worked elsewhere (or at least, their payroll isn't going to know this). They took out taxes (withholding) based on what you make *at that company*. You actually make more than that though, so you didn't have enough tax taken out once both incomes were combined.\n\nThe only way to fix this for this year is to pay the $60.  I feel like you've got the term withheld flipped around... They're withholding money from you to send to the IRS. If they didn't withhold it, you'd owe MORE than the $60. Did you not notice that your pay stubs had no deductions for taxes? \n Your tax withholding is not related to your tax liability.  Going to HR and telling them that you didn't want taxes withheld will not change how much you owe, and there's nothing they could do about it at this point anyway.  \n  \nUnless your W-2 does not reflect how much you were actually paid, and how much was actually withheld, you have no issue that your employer can help you with.  In the future, use the W-4 calculator that the bot linked to fill out your W-4 properly. > I will be contacting HR tomorrow when I go into work to see if I can have my W-2 form revised\n\nForm W-2 is a record of what you were paid from 1/1/2016 through 12/31/2016 and what taxes they withheld already on your behalf in 2016. Unless something on it is factually incorrect, they neither should nor will change it. if you want them to change the amount they withhold from your future paychecks, you would ask them if you can fill out a new form W-4. Note that if you already had underwithheld by $60 last year, changing your W-4 to have them withhold even less means you will owe even more than $60 next year. you filled out a w4s...so what number of exemptions and filing status did you claim?

All three returns must be signed and dated. Prioritize the 2013 return and get that filed as soon as possible, certainly well before the 4/15/2017 due date. Each return will take ~16 weeks to process, and you will receive separate refund checks for each tax year. You will need copies of your original tax form to complete the 1040x. And the deadline is 3 years from the date of filing. If you filed early, you may not be able to get copies of your 1040 from the IRS in time to amend the 2013 return. Filing a 1040x is not that hard, you can do it yourself if you've done your own taxes. But you need to look again for those original returns. Also, I think you should review the rules carefully and make sure you truly were independent and can claim credits before expending the effort to amend your returns.

", "title": "Food budget/budget food", "comments": "Check out r/EatCheapandHealthy A good starting point would be defining how much money you make yearly and dividing it by 12. If you try to measure it on a consistent month to month basis, you'll find it can be inconsistent if you work irregular hours each week (less than a defined amount of hours, so it will vary in amount paid), that is why I believe measuring it yearly/12 is the best way. \n\nNext, once you have an understanding of how much money you make, you'll want to focus on what are your current expenses? Try to lower them as much as possible with things you spend money on that you least enjoy, then increase the budget on the top 3 things that you enjoy spending money on and getting the most 'value' from. Whether it be going to the movies, eating healthy, or splurging on books, you decide. Cut unrelentingly on the rest.\n\nIf you find that you have less than enough, you may want to reconsider if you really find value in all the things you spend money on. \n\nThere is no one method of advice on determining on how much money you should spend on food without these numbers. It also largely dependent upon what you consider to be 'healthy.' How much money is a 'small' budget? These are all subjective. \n\nA good place to check out in my opinion, especially if you don't have credit is, Costco. I've found that the cost of $55 per year (4.58 per month) is worth it. If you spend more than $2750 per year or $230 a month on groceries or other things from Costco, it is worth the \"executive\" membership, in which, you earn 2% cash back on all purchases except Gas or gift cards, IIRC. \n\nCostco also has a wonderful return policy, I've even returned food I've already eaten, but found that I didn't like the food, and Costco took it back, no questions asked. It's a great place to spend money, get quality food, and pay a low price if you are decisive about what is deemed 'healthy' by you. \n\nFinal advice, go with a list and that will often help you avoid purchases you are not using logic in purchasing and rather often wasting money on. If you want something, add it to a separate list and if you think about it more than 3 times over a period of a week, then add to another list to buy.\n\nHope this helps, friend.

You'll beat them 100% of the time in the long haul with a standard invested brokerage account, but the annuity is an insurance product that has the simultaneous advantage of distancing the client from the money.

We got very generous cash gifts for our wedding and I had about $17k saved up in retirement savings.  A year after the wedding our cash gifts were gone and in 2013 we used the retirement savings to buy a house.  We started struggling with a credit card payment at the end of 2016.  We both decided to make a change and I started looking through the /r/personalfinance wiki and took a hard look at the flowchart and decided to make a poster and track our progress through it.  First things first I made a budget in Mint and realized we weren't far from where we should be financially.\n \nAfter looking at the budget we realized we had to cut a few things.  We cut our cable and now just have internet, Netflix, and Amazon Prime for entertainment.  The next thing we did is cut all restaurant, coffee shop, and other non grocery spending.  Lastly we cut back on overpayment on debt repayments and over saving on retirement ( like I said we were in a pretty good spot financially, we just had some priorities out of order).  \n\nWe suck at sticking with a spending limit in budgets so we did something that may be a little controversial around here, but hear me out.

Family of 4 and our budget is about 200 a month. We cook our own food a lot and make cheap meals. Being mexican americans means that beans, rice, eggs, and potatoes are big parts of our cheap diet. But meat is fairly cheap too. Whole chicken rarely go over a dollar a lb, and pork can be similar in price. For example, a imade a 7 buck pork roast that fed us today and will feed us tomorrow. In addition i purchased 40 flour tortillas and some cheese. Carnitas and quesadillas for dinner. Kids eat cereal and oatmeal for breakfast. I dont eat till dinner myself because of my job and preference. Veggies are pretty cheap too. Sometimes ill bake chicken, and cook some veggies in a little butter and ms. Dash, or something along those lines. Point is, learn to cook and shop and your food budget will be low. I spend ~$250 per month on food I eat at home. And then probably another ~$150 per month eating out with friends  We are a family of 3(daughters only 20 months so I assume it will go up a bit when she is older) and we spend $300 a month on groceries and $75 a month on out to eat.  I spend $550-600/month in grocery, that includes foods, soaps, etc.. anything sold at the grocery store, CVS, wines etc.  I get this from Mint.\n\nI know it sounds like a lot and here's why:\n\n* I prepare most of the food that I eat, from breakfast to dinner. I go out to dinner about 3 times a mont (almost every weekend, but not every weekend)\n* I am a big guy at 6'4\", I lift, so I eat about 3,000+ calories per day, every day.  Practically I have 5 meals per day: big breakfast, 2 lunches, 2 dinners. so 600/30days/5meals= $4/meal.  Again that's not just food but soaps, paper stuff, etc \n* lots of protein from grass fed beef, wild caught fish, and most everything is organic My wife and I budget $85 per week all-in. That works out to $2/meal each on average. The *only* way to be able to make this work is for you to pick up some basic cooking skills and sticking to them. I'm currently putting the finishing touches on a spreadsheet to help me track meal and serving costs, including recipes, ingredient costs, etc. The basics of it are this:\n\n* Write down *everything* you make. Every recipe for every meal, for at least a month. \n* Buy a cheap kitchen scale and measure everything you do. Measure solids in grams and liquids in millilitres. \n* Keep in mind yield loss. For example, if you're using a red pepper in something, your cost calculation needs to factor in how much of it is unusable. If you pay $3.99/lb (1lb = 454g) and the stem, seeds, membrane together weigh 35g from your 160g pepper, the cost for your pepper moves up from $8.79/kg to $11.25/kg. This is a key step that you can't skip if you really want to make the most of this. \n* Use the same ingredients in multiple recipes. Using the same ingredients multiple times won't save you money on your purchase but it will help eliminate food waste. Wasted food is wasted money. \n* On Sunday make your grocery list for the week. Exclude anything that spoils easily and can be picked up easily. Make your list by going through your entire fridge and any other food storage space. Write down only what you need. On Monday after work, make your grocery run on the way home. When you get home remove everything from your fridge and put new food in the back, old food in the front. Every night prepare basic ingredients for tomorrow's meals. Having stir fry tomorrow? Cut up vegetables today. \n* When buying groceries, pick up meat and dairy last. They spoil much quicker than produce and bread products. The longer they are at room temperature the faster they will go bad. One hour for milk takes off one whole day of its life. \n* The aisles in the grocery store typically contain the most expensive items. Pre-made, heat-and-serve, etc. Only go to the aisles for what you need. Coffee, tea, sugar, etc. \n* Be aware of serving sizes. You do not need to eat until you are stuffed, only until you no longer feel hungry. Overeating is as damaging to your food budget as food waste. They are, in effect, the same thing. I won't get into counting calories because I feel like it's a needless exercise for most people, just be aware of when you no longer feel hungry. You can always eat more later when you get hungry again. You can't un-eat if you feel over full. Calculate your serving sizes and costs and stick to your budget. Mix expensive servings, $3-4 each, with cheap ones, $1-2 each. \n* Lastly, have your phone out with you in the grocery store. Calculate the cost of everything. Just because it's on sale, store brand, or \"bulk\" size does not mean it's the cheapest per gram, pound, millilitre, serving, etc. \n\nStart following those for your basic meals. Once you're comfortable move on to other things. I make my own sauces for sandwiches now (they're all pretty much just mayo plus other things) as well as pickles, hummus, etc.\n\nThere's probably more to it, but that's the essence of what my wife and I have been doing for years. We've increased our budget from $50/week to $85/week in 10 years and we by no means eat poorly. We currently live in an apartment with a fridge from the 70's so it has an ice box instead of an actual freezer. We've had to get slightly more creative, but as others have said freezing is a great option if you have it. Be wary that you're not over preparing and throwing away freezer burnt food. Remember, the biggest threat to keeping yourself on budget with groceries is throwing food away.  You should probably calculate how many calories you consume each day and what type of food you consume/can make, then see how you can make your food cheaper per calorie. This will determine your food expense. ie: my average food expense is $140 per month but I eat about 1500 calories per day.\n\n\n\n\nAlso, sometimes it's cheaper to buy premade food than it is to make it from scratch. For example, it's cheaper for me to purchase premade sandwiches for $8 than to make it at home - because I'd need to purchase all of the ingredients that will end up going bad because chances are I won't want to remake the sandwich again.  Okay, so first know that I'm into food, definitely more \"live to eat\" than \"eat to live.\" So I break my food down into several categories. Here is how January's budget looks. \n\nAlcohol & Bars: $15 budgeted, $0 spent, $15 remaining\n\nCoffee Shops: $30 budgeted, $38.37 spent (took $8.37 from \u201cRestaurants\u201d), $0 remaining \n\nFast Food: $10 budgeted, $0 spent, $10 remaining\n\nGroceries: $230 budgeted, $246.40 spent, -$16.40 remaining (because I just shopped last night, it\u2019s the end of the month, and I won\u2019t be back at the grocery store probably until next weekend, I\u2019m deducting $16.40 from February\u2019s grocery budget)\n\nRestaurants: $100 budgeted, $65.49 spent ($8.37 to Coffee Shops), $26.14 remaining \n\nWork\u2019s Communal Kitchen Fund: $5 budgeted, $5 spent, $0 remaining\n\nTotal budgeted: $390 \nTotal spent: $355.26 \n\nI think this is a pretty typical month, though my groceries are a little higher than normal (I should probably just up my coffee shop budget though). I distinguish between \u201cfast food\u201d and \u201crestaurants\u201d not so much based on where I buy the food. It\u2019s more like, fast food=I forgot lunch so I grabbed something quick near work\u2026 while restaurant=dates, friends, social events, deliberately choosing to enjoy a dinner out rather than in.  \n\nI\u2019m 30, no kids, live alone, but my boyfriend does have dinner with me most nights. I know I could cut down on my food budgets, but I think I do okay, all things considered.  For one thing I eat a lot; this is partly because I run a lot but honestly I just love food. I also do the low(ish) carb thing; I\u2019m sure that helps drive up my grocery bill because I don\u2019t eat a lot of stuff that people tend to buy cheap. My diet is mostly meat, non-starchy vegetables, eggs, nuts, minimal fruit, rice eaten sparingly, corn tortillas when I want to treat myself. No wheat flour (so no bread or pasta), almost no potatoes. Pretty liberal with seasonings, etc. though. And despite what is probably a horrifying coffee shop budget to most people here, I actually do make most of my coffee and tea myself rather than purchasing it. That number is also half of what it used to be like 6 months ago, so I feel like I\u2019m making good progress there :) I\u2019ve gotten in the habit of cooking most of my food on weekends and then pre-portioning it out, so I\u2019ve cut down on my lunch/\u201cfast food\u201d budget substantially.  \n\nP.S. Sorry for the novel! (edited for formatting, little details) We (spouse and I) budget $240 a month for groceries/household goods and then we budget another $200 on eating out (which is the bulk of our entire entertainment budget).  I'm not sure what our groceries would cost if we reduced our eating out budget.  \n\nA few grocery tips:\n- Aldi is awesome if there's one near you\n- Less alcohol, less cheese, less meat = cheaper meals and often healthier\n- r/mealprepsunday! \n\nI find a really easy dish to make and eat a few days is pasta -- easy to find recipes for simple/tasty sauces, inexpensive, and yummy.  But not the most balanced/healthiest, so you'd want to pair it with fresh fruits and veggies during the rest of the day.  Casseroles are another good option.\n Probably about $200-250 month for two of us. \n\nWe also shop Aldi as much as possible, and I save a lot by stocking up from Amazon. I buy things on sale and whenever possible, subscribe and save. When you are subscribed to five things in any month, all five are an additional 15% off.\n\nTwo things I've always done that keep food costs down:\n\n1. Buy/eat what's on sale. I don't plan a menu ahead. If chicken is on sale, I cook chicken. If pork is on sale, I cook pork. \n\n2. Minimize waste. We had several kaiser rolls that were starting to lose freshness, so instead of throwing them out in a few more days, I made stuffing/dressing to go with dinner tonight. Don't throw away the bits of veggies left over every meal. Toss them all in a container together and make a quick veggie soup once a week. \n\nRight there, two fewer side dishes to purchase.  I spend between $100 - $125 a week on food for 2 people, so $400 - $500 a month. Its definitely high, but we don't eat out. My wife and I shoot for $1 per meal per person.  That's no more than $180/month for two people.  We usually come in at the $150-160 range. I am single, and purchase all my own food. I will say in advance I have a food allergy and also stray for certain foods/ingredients. I typically spend anywhere from 200-300 a month, depending on where I shop during the month. Use coupons! But that sounds about right as far as budget. Youll fluctuate for sure though, so I wouldnt set it in stone! I also cook fairly consistent, but thats also because of my allergy. Buy a recipe book of you need to. The amount of money youll save from cooking your own meals for the day is huge! Highly recommended. And if you arent any good now, just means you can get better.  Before my wife moved in with me, I was averaging about $200/month on groceries and about $75-100/month on eating out. You're going to see $100/month to $1,000/month entered here. It's all based on income and what priority people place on food spending. \n\nPersonally, I hover around $100-200/month in groceries, $100-200/month eating out, and $75/month on alcohol. \n\nYes, those are large ranges. It's typically about $300 combined, just depends on what form my eating takes. Alcohol is just a rough average - most of the time it's well below, but if I have a couple of dates (single) in a month, that's right or even too low of a number.  Looking at this thread, I'm realizing I definitely spend way too much.  I'm only cooking for myself, but I still manage to spend close to $400 a month in groceries.  I do live in Boston so maybe things are slightly more expensive here, but I need to work on paring this down.  And I do try to cook my own meals at least 4 times a week. $250. Could be cheaper but I pay a premium on more prepared foods like turkey burger patties instead of buying ground turkey and I do the patting myself, or pre sliced chicken tenders instead of buying cheaper breasts and cutting them myself. Try making ahead and freezing meals.\n\nI went from purchasing frozen meals to eat during the week when I don't have the time and energy to cook to making my own. I have experimented a lot over the years and found some good tips I wanted to share if anyone else wants to stock their freezer with tasty&cheap eats:\n1) Undercook food a bit (not meats,for safety) like rice and pasta, and even vegetables by a few minutes as foods will cook on re-heat.\n2) Cool foods quickly after cooking to prevent overcooking and for food safety- put your pot in sink with ice and water, set outside during the winter, pour onto sheet tray or smaller dishes, ect. Don't put your big batch of food in the fridge hot as it will take too long to cool to safe temp.\n3) Chill your foods in fridge overnight before freezing- this will inhibit freezerburn as warm foods will steam in freezer and leave that layer of frost on top. it will also keep your freezer from overheating and ruining your other foods in there with thawing/freezerburn\n4) if your food don't fill your containers all the way add a layer of plastic wrap to cover the food than put lid on, The plastic wrap should be touching the food and this helps prevent freezer burn. Wrapping containers in Aluminum foil also helps as it keeps the temp steady inside. (temp variations cause freezer burn)\n5) I prefer to thaw my meals the night before in the fridge to make reheating easier in the microwave- everyone knows how uneven frozen meals are when nuking them. If you cooled and froze your meals quickly after cooking they should be safe for a couple days thawed out unlike the commercial products that advise you to keep frozen until cooking.\nTL:DR I make my own meals in big batches and freeze so I always have home-cooked meal to eat everyday. These are lessons I learned to make it better. I'm single and eat out way too often. I budget $400/month for all food, including restaurants. I also have a $150/month \"entertainment\" budget that I didn't necessarily intend to include for eating out but sometimes my bar tabs/trivia night bar food get overflowed into this category as well.  \n\nFor reference I always go out for lunch with coworkers because it's a social thing and I wouldn't want to feel excluded, and then I try to be cheap on dinners (usually reheating some sort of frozen meat and frozen veggies).  Family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children)\n\nGroceries = $330 per month\n\nEating Out = $150 per month\n\nOnly do digital coupons and tend to stick to store brands. I budget $80 a week, for myself, my husband and 2 toddlers. I'm usually spot on (when buying meats) or under when I'm not. I but the bulk packs of meat and separate them, I'll get managers specials when available. I don't buy snack foods beyond crackers (my kids love them) and yogurt (I buy 1 week crackers, one week yogurt but buy the bigger packs so they last) I buy a lot of produce (try to keep with what's on sale). I can/do cook. If we want something like a baked good, I bake from scratch. I cook from scratch and use bones for soups as much as I have them.  Thanks for the post. Didn't know I was spending above avg here. I seem to be way high, I'm around $400 a month. May need to look into buying bathroom supplies elsewhere.  Family of three here. Groceries alone I'm at $300 a month. Seven year old girls eat like teenage boys. \n\nWe eat out once a week as a family and the occasional lunch out at work makes us around $200 on eating out in a month.\n\nFood is our biggest expense 100%. \n\nSo divide that by three I'd expect to be around $175 for a single person. Maybe $200 if you like to eat out or go to the bar. \n\nThen you also have to factor in location. I live outside of Detroit. Food is pretty average cost wise here, but if you're in Alaska it will be more expensive.  For 2 people we are at around $400 a month. It was $350 a month but we increased it as we decided to eat out less. That is our budget but it does not mean we spend that much. \n\nWe do one major trip each month. We drive out to Costco, buy all of our bulk items, mainly chicken, frozen veggies, TP, beef, etc. We buy cheese at Costco because we consume a lot and its better price wise. For smaller items, perishables, we go to Publix on the way back. At Publix, I buy mainly BOGO items, sale items, dry goods. If we get milk and eggs we get the small half gallon or half dozen size. We don't consume bread or alcohol during the week. But if we drink on the weekend we buy from Costco or drink during happy hours. We also have a small feezer in the garage where we store most of our chicken and frozen veggies so if I can get chicken at BOGO then I am set for almost 2 months.  \n\nEdited for brevity  This month, I budgeted, and I've spent $100 ($25/week) for the whole month. Mostly just chicken/vegetables/rice/sausages/fruits. Also, I live alone. I am also 25, living on my own. I give myself a budget of $300 for all purchases at the grocery/department store(so things like tp, shampoo, garbage bags all end up on the same receipt as my actual food and I'm not going to spend the time to look through them) and restaurant or coffee shop purchases. I would guess that $200 is a pretty good estimate for how much I spent just of groceries.\n\nI do sometimes have a hard time using my food before it goes bad since I prefer to cook raw veggies and meat for myself and simply don't eat enough, fast enough. I'm working on buying less/shopping more often which should help me save a bit more too. My SO and I together do about $300 a month in groceries. He does shopping for Costco stuff maybe once every other month, and I do shopping per what's left in the fridge/pantry each week. I shop the sales per weekly circular at our favorite store.\n\nI keep a stock of things that can be used for multiple things like bullion (soup, chicken pot pie, chili, gravy, etc), jarred/canned veggies like tomatoes (soup, pasta sauce, stews), rice (add different seasonings based on the dishes you make), bacon(wrap veggies in in, make breakfast, slap it on a grilled cheese),etc.\n\n\nCheck out local stores for sales. There's one near me (Harris Teeter) that routinely has sales like BOGO free meats, breads, and other items which can be frozen or don't expire w/in a week. Check out getting a Costco or BJs membership as well if you have one near you. Groupon has membership sales, or split with a coworker.\n\nCooking for one can be hard, especially if you cook for an army like I do. I learned to cook in the same quantities, and then freeze in portions so you don't have to eat the same thing every day, but in 2 weeks you'll have something good to eat :) You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Budgeting wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting)\n- [Spreadsheets section of the Tools wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools#wiki_redditor_created.3A)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

If you don't have vices, but cook more often and eat just a few times a month some sweets and fruits, your food cost will fit easy in the budget. All items bought from grocery stores (prescriptions, feminine items, other non food items) comes to 260 a month on average.  This year we are lowering it to about 170.\n\nNow for context I have always worked jobs that provide 1-2 meals a day and this year I have a job that will provide 19+ meals a week.  So we are definitely on one end of the grocery spectrum. We (2 of us) manage fine on $250/month for food I assume you folks with insanely cheap food budgets are not including other household items you get from the grocery store right? For my wife and I plus our youngster we budget $600/month but that includes food, toiletries, soaps, paper products, etc. We try to shop Aldi when we can and we splurge on organic milk for our daughter. But I am not going thru the trouble of creating a separate budget for ziplock bags, paper towels, laundry detergent, etc. I just lump it all together. My budget is gonna end up being lower when I move in with my best friend. He works for a massive processing plant so that means dirt cheap chicken, eggs, dairy, etc which will be amazing for my budget  I run at about 275 per month and that typically includes only one or two restaurant visits. I cook a lot, and I cook good food.  I eat a ton of seafood and other higher dollar items, and basically food is my favorite hobby.\n\nGroceries usually run around 600/month for 2 adults.  I also budget 300/month for restaurants, which is usually about once a week.  We are a family of 3 with a 1.5 year old. I keep track of every month and on average we spent $437.74 on food/groceries last year. This includes all purchases from a grocery store (food, toiletries, detergents, paper towels, etc.) and eating out. We spent around 800/month at the grocery store.  That includes things like diapers and formula since I have 2 kids under 2.  We also buy a lot of wine.  Have gotten better about food waste and meal planning but still not quite there.   Just for me it's $500 per month (slowly got it down from $850 per month). I commute over 3 hours a day and live in one of the most expensive areas in the US. I buy breakfast and lunch at work most days. About $50 per week for 2 people. But I also eat the same thing almost every meal during the work week. High protein, cheap carbs(rice, pasta, veggies). I know most people can't do that or aren't interested in it. I freaking love chicken and rice. \n\n Reading these comments I see that no one on PF is a powerlifter haha. I mean, some people here are eating @ $2 per meal, I can polish off an entire rotisserie chicken in one sitting on leg day. My single person food budget is about $300 +/- $50 per month.

Yu have the same chpoices as you would in an IRA or a brokerage account.  Being a 401k only afects the tax advantaged nature of the money inside of it.

If you want an expert to analyze your portfolio and help you understand it better, feel free to find a fee only CFP and ask him to go over everything.\n\n > How to avoid losing my 401k in the next stock market crash\n\nBest step to take is to not sell. Selling low is how people lose their money. So if you are already invested in funds that fit your needed asset allocation, stay the course and ignore the dips. Not really. You can't close a 401k and move the money to another account, then move it back in later. If you're truly that nervous, your best bet would be to invest the money in your 401k in something like bonds or a money market fund, which tend to drop far less than mutual funds or stocks in the event of a market crash.\n\nAll that being said, unless you're within 5-10 years of retirement, the *actual* correct answer is to make sure your 401k is invested in reasonable securities like ETFs, low-expense mutual funds, or target retirement funds, and just ride it out even if there is a crash, because as Warren Buffet says, \"time in the market beats timing the market.\" Do not do this. You have a much higher chance of losing money than if you just hold on through the crash. You only lose if you sell low. > pretty clear there will be another crash very soon. \n\nif that's what you think, I am sure your 401K has a cash or money market position.  Sell your finds and leave the money in the cash or MM position.\n\nNote: I am not agreeing with you about the market crash, or otherwise. I am just responding to your question on how to.....? Likely your 401k has a money market option, so essentially a savings account.\n\nWhen the market bottoms out is the hard part. Could be tomorrow. Could be a year. If you timed everything perfectly it would be beneficial, but that's the problem, the *if* Most market timers learn the hard way that buy-and-hold earns more money, because timers have to make two decisions perfectly and usually screw at least one of them up. Plenty of people who were shaking in their boots about the \"fiscal cliff\" (which prognosticators swore would lead to a massive stock market collapse) sold everything off in anticipation and then missed out on the massive subsequent rally.\n\nSee also the story of Bob, the [world's worst market timer](http://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/)\n\nAll that said, money market funds are basically the equivalent of cash inside your 401k. If you really don't want to be exposed to either market gains or market losses, sell shares of what you're holding now and use the proceeds to buy shares of whatever money market funds your plan offers. Markets always rebound. Like it did in 1929, 1987, and 2008.  Nearly all of the gains in the stock market come in just a few days, like less than 1% of days. The rest of the days you get nothing or worse. If you knew how to pick and choose exactly which day out of hundreds to be in the market and stayed out the rest of the time, we'd all be working for you.\n\nIf you want to reduce your risk allocate some of your 401k to bonds or cash and re-balance periodically.

Additionally, emotional decisions and pulling the money out will more than likely end up costing you more money in the long run as you sell too low and buy back in too high.\n\nWhile it may seem like a good idea to lead the market it is near impossible to time it because you can't account for all of the information and you can't account for other's emotional decisions that pump the market too high and dump it too low.  Will you need the money within 10 years?  What does your portfolio consist of in regard to stocks, bonds, cash, etc...?

Many scenarios could happen actually.\n\nJust place your 401K balance into the money market option.  When a 30% crash occurs, slowly put a quarter of the total back into stocks every three months.

However an opportunity to purchase a house has came up. below are the details.\n\nHouse: 3 Bedroom, 1 Bathroom, 1 story with a basement, about 900 square feet. Large attached garage (2 cars). 1 acre yard. deck, pool, etc. They are asking around $90,000 because that is currently what they owe on it.\n\nCurrent age: 23, no S.O., no kids, no pets\n\nCurrent income: I make $15.50 an hour, full time. So monthly gross on 40 hours is $2480 a month. I get about 6-10 hours of overtime every week but i know you are not supposed to factor in overtime for your monthly budget.\n\nCash: I currently have $6000 in the bank and i expect at least $3000 back at tax time within the next two months.\n\nDebts: I owe about $1500 in student loans, they are not in repayment but i have been paying on them anyways (interest starts in April 2017). I owe about $20,000 on my current car ($338 per month). no other debts. Credit cards are paid off every month. \n\nOther: I have about $30,000 in various stocks. Maybe $1000 in my 401k.\n\nCredit: Im not for sure what my credit score is now but when i purchased my car in November 2016 they showed me a 803 out of 850. I would guess its around 720 - 760 right now.\n\nNot sure if my formatting sucks or if i answered everything but would buying this house make sense? Is there any information that i left out that i should add? Has anyone else in a similar situation have any tips? I do think the house would be good for me, its not too big or small.

Since then she has led a normal life up until around three months ago. She started experiencing extremely bad stomach/liver pains once a month.  She has been to the ER once and urgent care and her primary doctor many times. Now the pain has intensified - it is more common now as it follows soon after any time she has solid meal . The only results of the tests have been that her white blood count has fallen from 2.4 (Low) to 1.6 (Extremely Low). And the ultrasound showed that her spleen is unusually large. Basically she feels like her immune system is turning on itself attacking the scar tissue in her liver.\n\n\n\nShe has a colonoscopy and a liver biopsy scheduled for Monday.  Previously she was working at a extremely high-end fashion boutique in La Jolla making minimum wage. Due to missing the last 3 days of work she was laid off on Friday. (is that even legal?)\n\n\n\nDue to being jobless I wrote her a $600.00 check so she could continue to pay on her bills (health-care, student loans and a driving without registration ticket. Immediately after the check cleared a bankruptcy lawyer that we've never heard of was able to garnish $750 from the account and charge $150 processing fee from the ~$720 she had left in her account. No letter, no phone call just straight robbery. She has stayed on top of the payments to the state and collections agencies. We called her bank who couldn't reverse it and the attorney's number(closed early for the weekend). She literally has $0.00 now and her other bills haven't cleared. \n\n\n\nShe literally cried for 8 hours on Friday. I really hate sob stories but I'm completely lost as to what to do. I'd rather face the whole ordeal as a realist and have: plan A, B and C just encase things get worse. \n\n\n\nDo I help her open another account so she can pay her bills? I don\u2019t have any debt, make $45k in IT so I can cover the basic food, rent, car payment). I did our budget before emptying my savings to pay for my college tuition. I expected us to be able to skim by before I saw any of this coming. \n\n\n\nWhat do I do to prevent her from giving up on life? What do I do financially to keep us afloat? Do I find us a financial counselor from my school? Do I take out student loans? If things get worse we could be looking at liver transplant how do you budget for such an event? Where do I start to get her current debt\n\n\n\n\nTL:DR girlfriend is deathly sick, has surgery Monday \u2013 debt collectors were able to literally empty her bank account before closing doors for the weekend. And to top it off she was laid off due to calling in sick. Need advice how to help her avoid hitting rock bottom and giving up.", "title": "Girlfriend fell deathly sick, need advice before things get worse", "comments": "If her accounts are being garnished, you should just pay all her expenses directly; don't let her handle the money at all. Where does she get her health care from? Was it from her job? Main reason I ask is because the ACA enrollment deadline is on the 31st of January, so you only have two more days to get her on it if she needs it.\n\nShe needs to apply for unemployment ASAP. That will get money flowing in at least.\n\nDid she already receive her last paycheck from her job? Was that part of the money taken from her account?\n\nFor her student loans, are they federal? If so, immediately call them and ask to be put on hardship deferment.  * Need advice how to help her avoid hitting rock bottom and giving up.*\n\nNone of this is her fault. She was in a vulnerable position (due to forces much greater than her) and got very unlucky. She didn't do anything to deserve this. She deserves to have health and financial security and love. The world didn't cooperate on the health and financial security, but it sounds like she does have love (from you), and must also be good at giving love (to you). What else truly matters about a human being? \n\nIt's true you don't know how things will turn out, if they'll get better or worse, but giving up won't lead to any better outcome than not giving up, and she may as well get to the bridge and at least peek across before deciding whether or not to attempt to cross it. (IE, take things one step at a time, try not to look either backwards or forwards for now).\n\nAgreed with the suggestion about you covering her costs directly. There may or may not be recourse for the amount already garnished, but even if there is it won't be fast. Look at that money as gone for now, and be glad it wasn't more.\n\nTry to do your best to be with her in the hospital as much as you can (especially if she doesn't have other family there). Not just for her morale but also to help make sure no one makes stupid mistakes about her care. You can also start figuring out how financial aid and bill forgiveness at the hospital works.\n\nIf her illness is making her unable to work, she may be eligible for disability, maybe medicaid or SSI. If you have down time, looking into that might help channel your worries in a useful way.\n\nI think it would be good for you to find a financial counselor, and possibly see a therapist through your school. They could maybe help you think through this and decide what your best course is. (Please tell me it's a legit public university and not a for-profit college). It may be loans or it may be deferment.\n\nDoes your girlfriend have family/friends either locally or further away that could help, either with financial or emotional support? It sounds like it's time to call all resources in. If I had a friend in this situation, I'd want to know and try to help.\n\nHang in there and hold on to your love. Does she have medical insurance at all? What genotype does she has? She obviously has developed cirrhosis by this time, unfortunately. The biopsy will tell a better picture.\n\n\nI developed Chronic Autoimmune Hepatitis C due to a contaminated blood transfusion, and had to take an immunosuppressant for many years before they came out with Harvoni. I developed cirrhosis by the time I was a teenager and my viral count was over 30 million. Without medical insurance there was no way I would have been able to pay for Harvoni - it turned a $64k 30-day supply into a $35 copay. After a full course of the drug - one pill a day for 12 weeks - I'm free of Hep C.\n\n\nThere are cures out there that don't involve a liver transplant. This disease is curable. She will make it through this. If you want to pay anything for her, buy a money order and mail it.\n\nThe vultures will find any new account and you don't want anyone she owes to get your info. 1. Prioritize: food and shelter first, everything can wait until AFTER recovery.\n2. She is not your wife. Do NOT pay her debts except for point 1. Recovery is priority number one, and that means food and shelter.\n3. Collections can collect when she's good and able to pay. When the collectors call, she can tell them that they can only contact her by mail. That's it. They are no longer legally allowed to call her (except to verify her address)--any more collections calls from them and she can sue.\n4. Her debt is not your debt. You don't know what the future will hold--you guys could break up, she could (God forbid) pass away. And then what? Wait for recovery to pay these things.\n5. Concentrate on her recovery first, and then get the rest of life in order.\n\nA lot of these were redundant. THere's a reason for that. Please pay attention.\n I can't help with the financial aspect much. My mom has Hep C from a blood transfusion after an accident in the 70s. I don't know if this will help your girlfriend's situation at all, but look into grants for treatments. My mom was able to apply for grants that paid for almost all of her treatments (I'm sorry; I can't recall all the specifics). Similar to college financial aid, there are loads of grants available that aren't claimed each year. Maybe something like that can offset future medical costs? \n\nAlso, if your girlfriend hasn't looked into it yet, there are also online support groups for people with hep C, and perhaps that would help her not give up. I know it helped for my mom, even just to stay optimistic (I think it worked, because after her last treatment, viral count is virtually nonexistent). Definitely make sure she's enrolled in ACA before January 31.  Second, this may or may not be worthwhile, but have her contact UCSD Health's Liver Center.  There are studies that target Hepatitis C.  As a study subject, the researcher sponsor covers her care.  https://health.ucsd.edu/specialties/gastro/areas-expertise/liver-center/research-clinical-trials/Pages/default.aspx \n\nSource: Friend who received Gilead's hepatitis C drugs during a study.  They used to have hepatitis C, now no viral load detected. Who garnished her bank account?  Was it related to these medical expenses?  There must have been something from way before because that's really fast for a garnishment.    If she has prior collections, I doubt her credit is any good anyway. I wouldn't worry about making regular payments.  Concentrate on keeping her health insurance going or help her file for Medicaid since she has no source of income. Since you're not married, I would not put yourself in debt (eg: take out student loans) to pay her medical bills.  In my opinion, that responsibility falls with her family if it is absolutely necessary.  However, she should apply for Medicaid or enroll through the ACA to get health insurance to help pay the medical bills.  You should also contact your local United Way branch so they can put her in touch with charities that will be able to help out.\n\nAs far as the debt collection is concerned, I would take /u/DanLynch 's advice and either have you or her family pay the bills directly. I know this will be tough if she's having surgery today, but you need to pull her credit report. Hopefully other users will correct me if I have this wrong, but I think you need a court order to garnish an account like that (I know you need one to garnish wages). See if you can figure out what debt this attorney is pursuing and if it's legitimate. Something like Credit Karma should work perfectly fine for this.\n\nIn the meantime, I agree with the posters who said to pay her bills out of your account if possible and make sure she is signed up for the ACA (she may qualify for free health insurance at this point, depending on the state you live in). The student loans need to go into forbearance until she's back on her feet. And you need to remember to take a little time to yourself, too. I can't imagine how hard this is for you, your response is basically saint-like.\n\nAs for not giving up, just remember you (and she) can come back from anything. She can always find her way back up, even if she ends up declaring bankruptcy or her credit score is trashed for the next 7 years. Monetarily, she can hit rock bottom, rely on the social/welfare net that is there for those situations, and then recover. The *only* thing you can't come back from is death, so she needs to do what it takes to stay alive and focus on getting better,  and just do her best with everything else. Please look into Gilead's Support Path program. If she is uninsured she can get Harvoni/Sovaldi/Epclusa for free through the program so long as she is eligible. Call as soon as possible so you can get things moving. Hep C is not a death sentence, Harvoni has been shown to cure many people.\n\nThe number is 1-855-769-7284 and website is http://www.gilead.com/responsibility/us-patient-access/support%20path%20for%20sovaldi%20and%20harvoni Prepare for the possibility she will go through a bankruptcy. Keep your bills and credit separate and your credit good. One of you having good credit will be helpful in the future. Worry about getting her treatment not paying her medical bills. Keep all the medical bills in her name. Do not assume any debt for her or sign anything to help her with finance.   Public assistance is available for people with no income and no assets.  Contact your local government agencies for welfare, etc.  She likely will end up with better options for medical care, food, and housing assistance than what you can do going it alone. Also she maybe able to file bankruptcy, but I would wait until after the transplant. Also have her file for benefit. In CA have that kind of serious illness should qualify her. \n\nUntil then just pay the vital bills yourself. She may be able to qualified for Medicaid or Medicare since her health is making it so she is unable to work. Also look into TANF and Social Security for disabled.  Also apply for unemployment, you never know. Your state should have a site that lets you apply for all the benefits at once. We all pay into these systems when we work and pay taxes, and they are \"intended\" for situations like this.  Does she have Short-Term Disability Insurance?  If so, she will receive a percentage (usually 70%-80%) of her normal paycheck after she is not able to work for a few days to two weeks.  However, this isn't automatic.  You have to contact the insurance company and get a claim started to get the money flowing. I know this is not the right forum, but you should know that hepatitis C is curable with a very high rate of success.   curable with a capitol C.   \n\nhttp://www.webmd.com/hepatitis/features/cure#2\n\n91% cure rate after a 12 week dose of the drugs if the strain matches. I'm no financial advisor, but I work at a major liver transplant center and specialize in hepatitis c and liver cancer. Not going to lie, her symptoms are indicative of advanced disease and cancer. Honestly it wouldn't hurt to call a liver transplant center (or two or three). Even if they don't accept your insurance, they may have financial coordinators who are willing to guide you. At least at my transplant center, even if we can't see a patient due to financial issues, our coordinators are willing to give advice and options.  My experience is not in finance but in assisting with medical expenses. \n\nThis may have been mentioned (I read like half the comments... but not all) depending on what state you're in there may be County Indigent Health Funds. If she's unable to work at all she might qualify. I know in Texas each county can be a strict or lenient as they like within state guidelines. Call your county courthouse and see if there are Indigent Assistance Programs. \n\nWww.texashealthcommunityconnect.org allows you to search your zip code and gives you a list of assistance programs. This can give you ideas of all kinds of programs to meet any kind of need (food, utilities, local assurance etc.) \n\nTalk to the social workers or case managers at the hospital she is at. They are likely to be well versed in the local programs and agencies that can help. \n\nHopefully she's at a hospital that has a financial assistance program. Depending on the hospital she could be eligible for up to a 100% write off on bills from the hospital directly. \n\nhttp://www.needymeds.org/copay_diseases.taf?_function=summary&disease_id=279&disease_eng=Hepatitis%20C&dx=12&drp=hepatitis%20(all) \n\nHere is a link to assistance programs for Hep C. Hopefully you live in a state with a program. \n\nAlso, depending on what all procedures she is needing now or In the future you can check out www.mdsave.com This site allows you to price compare procedures and purchase the lowest cost. \n\nEdit: Also most major pharmaceutical companies have patient assistance programs. If she is prescribed any expensive medications it is worth a google \"medication name patient assistance program\" This may be a bit of a strange suggestion, but if you can move to Europe (as a tech worker, you may be able to) or Canada, you could potentially significantly decrease the costs of your GF's healthcare since those countries provide healthcare free or cheap out-of-pocket in exchange for paying taxes basically.\n\nOtherwise, you're in a tough spot. You're going to want to get a full picture of where her debts are and then talk with those creditors and get a plan in place. Something in writing. I honestly don't know what else you can do. Make sure she has some sort of health coverage to minimize the costs of her care (especially the stuff that's coming up).\n\nBest of luck. If you two can make it through this, know that you will be stronger than most. You've been dealt a terrible hand, and it's probably worth it to make sure your GF knows that none of this is her fault.

This year, my wife and I had a trip to Japan planned for May, for which we found tickets at around $550 each, and we have already paid for housing (around $700 total). \nAll is good and happy, until I realize my F-1 visa has expired. With an expired F-1 visa, I can stay in the country without problems, as long as my status as a student is still valid (usually associated with having your \"I-20\" form); but if I do leave the country, I have to have it renewed before I am admitted back into the US. Also, know that I cannot renew my visa WITHIN the US, as I have to do it through a US Consulate/Embassy (it is suggested that I do it in my home country).\nI have thought of some options so far.\n\n1. I've been thinking of simply cancelling our trip to Japan and staying in the country until I have my permanent residency (green card). The problem with that is that (a) we've already paid for our flights and United charges a $300 cancellation fee PER TICKET. That would be 4 tickets, 2 people round-trip; (b) we would also have to cancel our housing (although I do not expect too high of a cancellation fee on those); (c) we would miss out on probably the biggest opportunity of visiting Japan for the next several years.\n\n2.

Simple. Your parents will likely want to claim you as a dependent.  Key word there is \"want.\"  While the technical answer involves measuring who (you or your parents) paid your living expenses for the majority of the year, the more practical answer is that they will (and should) claim you.\n\nIn the IRS' eyes, they would want you to claim yourself, since the personal exemption in your income bracket yields more tax revenue for the government.  For example, if you are in the 15% tax bracket and your parents are in the 28% bracket, the personal exemption deduction of $4,050 creates a $608 benefit for you and a $1,134 benefit for your parents.  While the IRS could never really make a case for you to claim yourself, they certainly would benefit if you did.\n\nHope this helped!

I know that over the years, they had sent me far more than $300, one time my father giving me $2000 that he specifically told me was for my personal use. My mom even told me she took all of it when my dad sent it, saying it was a way to pay back for raising me and to cover our expenses, but my dad is under no child support obligation. She simply took the money because she felt it was right, and that doesn't even take into account that my grandfather sent me $1000 that same day, yet someone how that is missing from my account as well.\n\nThere have to have been thousands saved up in that account, and I never once touched it because I knew it would be better to leave it alone. My trust in my mom is absolutely gone. Every time I asked her about how much money was in my account, the number would always conveniently change, and whenever I would ask to get access to the account, she would always tell me she would get me the information and then never do anything about it. \n\nThat's not even taking into account the times she's openly admitted to taking money from me, like when she asked me for $600 when I couldn't have been more than 12, or when she finally fessed up that my account had around $700 left because she had to take some in order to keep the house (she got into a legal issue around a year or two ago). \n\nFurthermore, I believe that my godmother, who lives with us,  has stolen money from me directly from my wallet and checkings account. I feel like this because there has been a series of very disturbing instances over the years like finding my debit card in my wallet flipped upside down, and a charge on my account that very day that had the pin used.

Get a new bank account in just your name and get the rest of your money out of the old account and transferred to the new one.

If there's no money in the account the debit card will not work.  \n\nSo the first question is what type of account is your debit card linked to?\n\nIn some cases, people have what's known as prepaid credit cards.  The person pays the credit card company in advance and can use the card until there's no money.  Depending on the card and its features, sometimes this type won't even build your credit score, it acts just like a debit card except without a physical bank account.\n\nSo the next question is does this card show up on your credit report as a credit account?\n\nFinally, to answer you question, closing a checking or savings account (and most prepaid credit cards) that has a debit card associated with it will not hurt your credit because they don't do anything to build your credit. Your debit card does not appear on your credit history.  Without a prepaid debit card or checking account that offers deposits, ATM withdrawals and bill pay it is going to be more expensive than $6/month to manage your finances because you'll have to pay individually for services like cashing checks and purchasing money orders.  \n \nFind a better checking account - you can get a free one online through a bank like Ally or CapitalOne360, and many brick & mortar banks and credit unions offer no-fee accounts for students.

Michigan has the worst insurance rates in the entire country.  This is because, in the event of an accident, your policy is required to be the primary provider of medical and work loss expenses.  Also, being under 25 and being anywhere in a 100ish mile radius of Detroit hurts as well.  \n\nIf you have regular health insurance (Blue Cross, Cigna, ect.) you can make them your primary provider instead (your auto insurance will want proof of coverage).  Also, ask your car insurance if they offer discounts for taking defensive driver courses.  Also, things like having better credit will help in the long run. Not really. When I lived in MI, before moving to another state, my insurance quote for a leased 2016 Jeep was $1,200/month. Not per six months, per *month.* This was a major factor in forcing me to move and leave the state. I now pay $140/month for the same insurance, thank you no-fault.  So I would say make sure you keep shopping around. I live in Michigan and pay on average under 600 for 6 months of insurance. Also that's full coverage. \n\nA tip that I would suggest is looking at your coverage details. For example, what is your deductible set at? Most people set it to a low number. That is fine if you are planning on getting into an accident, but for that coverage, you are paying more a month. I have mine set to about 1000$ deductible. I have an emergency savings, and actually a car savings as well, but by doing that it typically drops my monthly premium around 50$.  The obvious advice is make sure you shop it around a lot. Check your coverage's. Raise deductibles if you have an emergency fund. Move where you live. We just added our kid (female) to our auto policy...

There's a difference between investing and day trading.  Long term stock investing, as many prudent folks view it, is a method by which you purchase stocks at regular intervals in small quantities over a long period of time.  To make it even simpler, most folks buy index funds and don't even mess around with individual stocks.  You check your account once a year and re-allocate as necessary, but ultimately do not care what the market does over the short term.\n\nDay trading is essentially gambling.   Investing definitely helps you build wealth over time. You want to buy low-cost index funds to capture the returns of the broad stock market, and minimize fees. Trading costs add up and hurt you over time. Long term investing in index funds is a great idea and requires no financial skills.  To clarify what the other folks here are saying (and I agree with them): don't buy individual stocks, buy index funds.  They're much easier to manage for a person new to investing and you'll probably get  better returns. Investing in stocks is a great idea!

That is including at other campuses of this same charter school. I raised my concern and was told that they just wanted me to stay for the dismissal of the kids, and help a bit around at the meetings, forcing me to staying 3 to 4 hours after all the kids leave. When I told them that I'm not qualified to be in any sort of teacher meetings (I have teacher friends who can confirm what I was telling them) they said they would look into modifying the offer.\n\nNow the new offer came in, in which I work 38-39 hours, no healthcare/dental, and a pay raise 1 year into my total employment.

This is his first real job and source of income. So he's not used to all this money. \nRight now, his dad and step-mom have asked him to co-sign for a loan refinance on a house that he won't be living in any time soon. \nNot only that, they want him to contribute a some of his income to the monthly payment. \nHe doesn't know anything about personal finance and credit. So he's been going through with this, signing documents and providing pay stubs. Although the refinance isn't complete, he's been contributing $500/month already to them. This leaves him broke and unable to really do anything fun/exciting like a young marine should be doing in Japan. Not to mention he's not putting anything away in a retirement account or savings account. \n\nThe dad works as a truck driver and the step-mom doesn't work but gets disability from the state. They have been promising him that he will see a LOT of money in the far future. But they also say they will never sell the house and instead keep it in the family. This doesn't make much sense to me. \n\nI understand if they default on the mortgage payment, he'll be held accountable as well and it will screw his credit. \n\nIs there anything anyone can see that would positively impact him?

As far as I can see, you need to have a strong handle on what's incoming and what's outgoing, and why. Also have an eye on bottom line necessities, like insurances and tax filings. In your shoes, I would look for a similar sized non-profit with an experienced financial director, preferably one with an aligned mission who would feel pity and solidarity for you, and beg them to mentor you.  /r/businessfinance seems to be dead, but you might luck out there as well.\n\nI would see if there is a professor who teaches business finance to mentor you.

So I inherited 250k and before we were just getting by paycheck to paycheck, and currently we are dipping into this inheritance in order to get by since food stamps have stopped coming in. I'm 19 and live with my non-college educated immigrant mom, 17 yo brother and 13 yo sister. Our father is an alcoholic so about 14 years ago we lost all of our financial stability and he doesn't live with us anymore(long story...) \n\nI'm looking at this inheritance as a way to get out of the rat race in a sense. Buying a <50k house in a state where the public education system/state university system is good is what this would essentially boil down to, pretty much allowing us the ability to all go to college and establish careers without worrying about how to live (we currently rent in NJ, which is insanely expensive) \n\nDo you guys think this plan makes any sense? what are the downsides to buying a house?  we were thinking somewhere where the property taxes are cheap too. \n\nLet me know what you guys think", "title": "Inherited 250k No breadwinner in family, should I buy a house?", "comments": "a) Do not assume college is a \"magic ticket\" to a high income career. PLENTY of college graduates are stuck with lots of loans and a relatively low income. You should think about what you want to do as a career first, and then figure out what kind of education you need.\n\nb) Owning a house is expensive, even in a low cost-of-living area. Moving to a cheaper area might be a good idea, but I wouldn't automatically assume buying a house is a good idea. This could work. I'd be a bit concerned that you'd end up spending a lot more of it than anticipated in the costs of moving, locating a new house, purchasing it, fixing the inevitable things, furnishing it, etc. \n\nWhat about investing it in an income fund? This amount could provide you with about $800/month of income, indefinitely, if used that way. How would your current situation look with that extra income coming in every month no matter what? Lansing michigan has cheap homes and taxes, also has community college and msu, friendly to foreigners too You could look into moving to Tennessee.  My sister in law lives about 30 minutes from Nashville.  Homes are pretty cheap there (her first home was $100,000). Property Taxes are ridiculously low (her first home was $600 a year) and there is no state income tax.  I believe they also offer free community college state wide. You'll definitely be better off living in a cheaper area. Plenty of states with a significantly lower average cost of living. Buying a house if you have a large sum of money available I believe would be a good option. Renting is nice, but limited. Its similar to the idea of owning or leasing a car. You lease the car to have no worries about repairs and so fourth. Owning a house will have many more benefits than simply renting an already owned house. That being said, once you do buy the home, you could always sell but it would be important you buy it somewhere comfortable for you and your family. If you are only 19, you have many years to try and figure out what it is you want to do. If pursuing you education is what you feel like will help, then do it. The Econ0mist makes a valid point though. Do not assume it will put you in a money making situation. And more importantly, do something you like. I know your situation may seem like the only way out is money, but enjoying something youll be investing your life into is much more important.  I would suggest buying a relatively affordable duplex, living in one side, and renting out the other. In some situations, you could live mortgage-free! Plus if you wanted, you could go with an FHA loan, which would only require you to put roughly 3.5% down. Good luck! That sounds like a sound plan, though good public education and university systems often do go with higher housing costs. \n\nHow savvy are you? Do you understand the tax implications of the inheritance? Was it all in your name? Is it possible that your mother and younger siblings' entitlements could be preserved? What do you know about home maintenance?\n\nI inherited no money but a ton of responsibility when I was a little older than you. Looking back, I made some mistakes but overall did ok. But oh Lord I want you to have the benefit of someone older and wiser supporting you in this process. Do you have a relative that you both personally trust and who has a good sensible track record with money? Can you find an advisor who would have a fiduciary responsibility towards you?\n\nI thought I had to do everything on my own, but there would have been help if I had been able to ask for it. With a big pot of money you'll have to be a little wary. But still.  While is is great to move to a cheaper area, you might look at ones with a decent infrastructure and future employment prospects. Your mother and you have jobs and make sure you both can work and the college education is decent wherever you move. \n\nYour brother probably has a career in mind too, and I would call it a 'family loan'  to your siblings rather than a gift so the expectation is i the future they will pay it back e.g. contribute to care for your mother when she is elderly and contribute to the family with part time work. He may not be interested in College and i thoroughly recommend learning a trade as a good alternative. A good tradesperson out earns a college graduate surprisingly often. \n\nDon't let the money get spent on living expenses if possible- besides in my experience, people with part time jobs are really committed to making their education meaningful as they respect the value of a dollar. Same goes for your sister as she gets older. don't spoil them- or your one chance to make a better life is gone. \n\nAs a child of an immigrant parent, you will also want to consider where your mother might find a familiar community, especially if her English isn't great.  Honestly, I like the idea of buying a home in your situation. Though, yes, homes are expensive, if you can buy one with cash, you'll have a guaranteed place to live and save your $1-1.5k in rent (I'm assuming your rent is in this range based on the number of people in your household and the fact that you live in NJ). Still have to pay for utilities and property taxes, but that's manageable when you don't have rent or a mortgage to pay.\n\nWith a modest take-home pay, it's reasonable to think you can probably save up money month-to-month, assuming you move to a cheaper place to live.\n\nOn the whole, it's a good plan OP. I would move somewhere cheaper where you can buy a home that will work for your whole family for <$200k and put the rest in investments. Use your returns from said investments initially to put together an emergency fund (along with savings from work), then think about retirement funds and other long-term problems. Was the inheritance from your grandparents?  I would move to a cheap area. Invest then money and as others have said you could pull $800 a month out. Definitely go to school, Physical therapy first. It gets you a good income and there is a real need. Plus many jobs pay for education. For you to advance your degree (become an MD) at a much lower cost while making income. I'm not well versed enough to give you financial advice, but I do have a suggestion, depending on where you live. Some small Midwest towns have fantastic schools and cheap housing compared to other areas. \n\nOn another note, downsides to buying a house include upkeep, repairs, utilities, potential liability hazards (insurance can cover this for a bit extra, in most cases), and the area's cost of living.\n\nEdit: Somehow missed that you live in NJ. I still suggest moving a bit towards the Midwest, if possible. Take $10k and put it in your bank account put the rest in a savings account and let it sit until you plan it out on paper. Use the $10k for expense for the next year, no lifestyle changes.\n\nBuying a house isnt a bad idea its a way of forced savings for people who are not used to a sudden amount of money. My guess is you wont qualify for any loan unless you have a job so you would have to pay all cash or for a co signer. \n\nIf you plan on leaving the house then go buy a place near the school you want to attend and rent a room out or hopefully you can buy a 3 bed house and rent 2 rooms out and have that basically pay for expenses and maybe more.  Honestly the safest bet for you is to go into skilled trades. In the trades industry, you're capable of getting paid while learning, and lower tuition costs. Once you graduate, you'll be making some relatively decent money after 4 years and if you really wish to make that 250k work for you, then learn about starting your own business. Majority of the bosses I met from trades started off as a worker, saved money, and started their own business. If you get lucky and run a successful business and have a good reputation you'd be capable of earning 200k+/year easily I think the biggest issue you'll have is coming to consensus on a decision. Depending on who inherited and how it'll be shared. While buying a home may be an option, the cost of owning a home will be over bearing if you're facing challenges with food, clothing and shelter right now. There's a great deal of sound advice on this thread regarding investment, but i really think you and the family should consider both investing a portion of the money and with another portion purchasing a family business around $50k (like a dry cleaner.) \n\nIf you purchase a business, any time spent in school will be skills applied at work.\n\nYou'll be able to write off a ton of expenses and also generate income with a solid work ethic and build something together as a family. If the small business works out and you wish to expand, like purchase another dry cleaning business, you have some money from your investments to expand with. \n\nRegardless do your research and compare Professional opinions. \n\nUltimately the goal is to have everyone in your family be financially independent by growing the money, not splitting it.\n\nAlso, before buying a business always spend a 6 months to a year working in that line of work. That way you learn the ins-n-outs. But by no means ever tell the person you are working for you have money to buy it. Then they'll try doing all sorts of shady stuff to sell you their business.  You should only purchase a home when you have earnings that will pay all property taxes and home owners insurance, and not have to use the remaining 200k to pay these expenses. \n\nYou are better off investing this money in a moderate aggressive mutual fund that will earn atleast 5%, and your capital will grow. I would find another job that pays more money to pay these expenses, and invest it. Otherwise you could wind up in hard times in 10 years.\n\nSource: I'm typing for my father who is a senior mortgage officer and has been in the business for 27 years. Best of luck to you  I like the idea of buying a modest house. Mom and bro need to flip burgers and contribute to a account for repairs. You can go be a doctor, but that is going to take a long time and put you in debt. With this you will have a home which is what people work to have anyway. Stay away from debt and find a job. Between 3 of you a simple retail job will be easy to pay the bills with. To the OP, most places that have cheap homes also have no jobs.  A home priced at $50,000 is priced that way due to market conditions, not some 'bargain'.  If everyone there is making minimum wage, the market won't allow a 'normal priced' home to exist.  While I'm not keen to telling folks to invest their savings, it sounds like you and your family haven't learned to manage money.  Invest it.  Preferably somewhere that you cannot retrieve it for a long time.  This sounds harsh, but FYI I'm currently going through Chapter 7... Sounds like a great plan. Buy a house have a bit left over for property taxes and insurance and maybe utilities and you are set for a good long while.\n\nGood luck! i would invest that money.  in ten years you could have half a million, in twenty you could have a million. I agree. I meant that both aren't that good for someone with money issues. Even if you use your skills, it doesn't mean it's worth the education. I know lab assistants and techs making less than 50/yr with way more schooling than anyone I know on Wall Street or engineering or that sort  go to cc for computer science then transfer to a 4 yr in state public school for computer science while applying/getting internships. I would move from NJ immediately. Your money will go much farther than in any other state. \nAbsolutely. But instead of buying a single-family home, purchase a duplex and live in half while you rent out the other half. With either no mortgage or a very small one, the rental property will provide passive income. Because you live there, you will be able to keep a close eye on the tenants and keep on top of maintenance. It is best for an inexperienced owner/landlord to only manage one unit on the first go.  If you do this right you will have a very low (or no) mortgage payment and pull in $1,000 per month in income. Don't buy a house. Buy a four-plex or multi-family unit. Rent out other parts of building. profit. See biggerpockets.com for more advice. Yea I say do it. I'm not well versed on the housing market, but maybe 100K is the more likely amount you'll have to spend on a home. Take 30K and put it in a \"the roof needs to be replaced and our boiler just exploded\" fund and use the rest to cover your college tuition. Good idea. Here is my advice with why:\n\n1) Buy a house. Aim for under 50% of what you have in cash (so $125,000 or less.) **Remember that you WILL pay somewhere around $3000 in closing costs** Get the house inspected (a couple hundred) and make sure you get something in good shape. Avoid town houses or anything with an HOA if you can. Taxes on that house should cost you around $100 a month and utilities will range but you should be safe at under $400 a month for them. Insurance wouldn't be required but GET IT, that $500 a year you spend on it can be a life saver should the worst occur. $550 a month is a full time minimum wage job (Roughly $880/month take home) so worst case scenario you can live on one income.\n\n2) Put half of what is left (at least $62,500) into college funds or long term savings/investments. Assume you will lose all of this money either way. If it goes to college you will (hopefully) see it return over time in income and if it goes to long term savings you won't be able to touch it for a long time (and the market could tank and you will lose a lot of it.) Both have risks and both have rewards.\n\n3) Put half the rest into savings (minimum $31,250) and pretend it doesn't exist. This is your emergency fund. Cheap housing has problems. Cars break down. You will probably spend money on stuff you shouldn't because you have money (and family might leach it $10-$20 at a time for years)\n\n4) Take the last bit (at least $31,250) and live off it until you can find a job or start college and use it for the 5 years you will be going (few graduate in 4 anymore, especially since you will probably have to work part time.) College will be tough since the money will run out quickly (4 years if you only pay for the house and nothing else) so you will need part time work. For work, I found trades to be the best. Find something with certificates you can get without needing a lot of schooling like construction (electrician and plumbing) or driving (Semi-truck, dump truck, anything outside the normal drivers license.) If you get a good, stable job take some of the money to get reliable transportation. $10,000 can actually get you a new car with a 5 year warranty. The rest is then additional savings or hazard funds.\n\n5) You are not responsible for your family. You are not your siblings parent nor are you required to give your mother a payout for her taking care of you. Big money can cause a lot of issues in a family. If you want to be generous, let them rent from you for cheap ($100 or so a month) but don't let it be free (well, except your siblings until they are done with school.) Free is bad, free sets a bad precedent. You can be kind while still letting them know they can't take advantage of you. You can be stern without being an ass or making relationships suffer. \"You can stay with me if you take care of the electric bill\" or \"Rent is around $500 a month for a place around here, 80% off is the family discount\" is hard to argue against. I say this from experience, family is a wonderful thing but it can also be the worst thing in existence if you aren't careful.

In my mind depends on whether you intend on keeping the house and renting it out after you move out. If you don't want to be a remote landlord or pay a management service, I wouldn't buy a house for 3 years, especially with no money down. Transfer costs (realtor fees, closing costs, etc) would delete any potential profit, and if the house doesn't appreciate considerably, you could end up losing a lot of money on the deal.

I wouldn't consider $1K tiny, but I guess some might.

Saving a lump sum of cash or paying down a chunk of debt can do wonders for keeping people on the path to good money management and financial independence.\n\nTo you're point, if the refund is being spent recklessly or to catch up on delinquent payments, then it makes no sense not to keep the money up front. I know a guy that did this exact thing. One year to pay for a wedding and a new car he sold a ton of stock and didn't send a payment. The fines he paid that next season blew a lifetimes worth of savings, not to mention the time he spent doing tax calculations to hit $0.00... I always find it strange that people rely on their tax income money to pay for important things, like bills. (i.e. my mother) I'm pretty sick of hearing the \"free loan\" shit regurgitated from every person that thinks they have everything figured out. There's reasons to pay more taxes than you will owe throughout the year. For instance, if you freelance in addition to a W-2 job. Plus, not everyone wants a fucking bill come tax time. Quit it with this shit. I try to minimize my return. When I have had a big change in income or circumstances, I've redone the previous years return with an estimate of my new income/deductions/etc. That got me closer to zero. Oddly, for this year if I did the math right I am paying a few hundred in federal, getting a few hundred back in state. the amounts are within $25 of eachother, so it's nearly a net zero.\n I've had to pay in every year the last 3. \neach year though, I've gotten closer to 0. Taken some time to figure it out.  Or use them as your bank since they pay higher interest when they owe you money.  I will always have a tax refund. I deduct my meals and contribute into RRSPs. Getting 2-3K of my money back each year is great. I could care less if it's in a lump sum. Forget about not letting the government have a free loan, it's a non-issue. I shouldn't have over 30% of my money taken from me by violent parasites who spend it on things I find morally abhorrent.

Don't feel that you have to spend a lot of money and don't get into debt to get the ring or get married.  Personally, I think you'll be getting ripped off when buying any diamond.  Especially for an engagement ring.  I've always questioned the thinking behind spending 2-3 months salary for an engagement ring.   This short vid confirmed my suspicions.  \n\nhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=N5kWu1ifBGU\n\n whats her ring size,whats your budget,\nhttps://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=engagement+rings\n My plan is that I've got a savings that I contribute a small amount to each month. So I hope that when the time comes for me, I'll have enough saved to cover the cost. But it sounds like you're planning a lot sooner, so this is kinda my idea for if I need to finance it a bit.\n\nI hope to open a new credit card, hopefully one that has some sort of rewards or something I'm interested in, but that absolutely has 0% APR for 12+ months. That way, I'll put the purchase on that card, use what I have saved to knock off a chunk of the payment, and then have a year or so to pay off the ring without accruing interest.\n\nBut still be careful to not get in too much debt, that \"plan\" is still something I'd rather not do. Checkout [moissanite rings from Gemvara](https://www.gemvara.com/b/moissanite-engagement-rings/). They will be cheaper than diamonds of similar size. I assume your future fianc\u00e9 doesn't care about the stone as much as the love associated with the act of proposing. I am morally against buying rings but in reality I bought one for my wife. I used a site called Angara. Got a really nice diamond and ruby ring for way cheaper than it could have been. And they let you split the payment into two with no interest. I'm only plugging because I've purchased from them twice (engagement ring  and a wedding band) and been very satisfied.  They give you a lot of options to choose the quality and size to fit budget.  \n\nYou could also just sit down and do research with her about what the diamond industry is really like and that might get you off the hook for an artificially expensive ring.  2-3 months salary is the rule that the diamond cartel made up many years ago and has promoted enough that now everyone stupidly believes it.  Just talk to GF, as she probably should know what you make and how much you have saved up.  Figure out together what you can afford, and let her help you pick it out.\n\nAnd a jewelry store isn't the best way to go.  How about a non-diamond, or an estate sale, or a relative's ring that no longer uses it but would have family memories with it? Don't go into debt for a piece of jewelry. You will need your money for things that bring much more value to your life than a rock. You can upgrade the ring for your 5th or 10th anniversary (or later) when you have more disposable income and know what it actually costs to support your family. Also check out James Allen.  Great pricing.  Great customer service.  Payment plans.  One of the only one stores that has magnification shots of all their diamonds. https://www.etsy.com/search?as_prefix=diamond+e&q=diamond+engagement+ring&order=most_relevant&view_type=gallery&ship_to=US&max=500\n\nEtsy is good, just read reviews and make sure the seller is reputable.  Love isn't defined by precious metals. True love transcends the materials world, sadly it seems you have not found it Buy used online but always have the ring checked out before purchasing it. Having a ring made is more than twice what the product will probably be worth. Alot of jewelery stores do offer payment plans though so that might be something you look into.

The company stock is a bit volatile in the short term, however it does continue to increase and I don't see it tanking any time soon. (The company has been around for 110 years)\n\n2. Is it worth keeping the 401k under the management of the provider?(Voya) I don't want to spend the time managing it so I figured it was better than just setting it and not doing anything with it. They charge $5.39 a month, at least that's been the charge the last few months, it might be a percentage based on value.\n\n3. I am currently in repayment on my student loans as I had taken time off of school, however I am back at school part time now. Should I ask for my provider to put them back into deferment and just continue making payments or just not worry about it? I wasn't sure if going back into deferment would affect my credit or anything. I will be in school for at least another year, possible year and half to get my bachelors. Once I have my degree I will be planning on getting a higher position in the company.\n\n4. Also on a somewhat side note, I have not filed my taxes yet for 2016. I was curious based on my situation if you think it would be worth paying to have my taxes done for me? In past years I have just been using the free version of TurboTax, although based on what I had put in so far TurboTax was saying I needed to use their Deluxe version. I was considering having them done a professional at least once just to see how they do it. I was also looking at the free options that are offered locally by volunteers, I was looking at the services United Way offers locally. \n\n*spelling", "title": "[24M] Looking for some advice on my current financial situation.

It is better to get investments such as real estate (which you can rent), businesses, rather than having your money do nothing in a savings account. Don't focus on saving money, focus on obtaining more of it. Although saving is nice $1.00 today may be worth $0.70 years from now. I might put a portion into MBA but I would first look for loans with a decent interest rate. Assuming you have $105k I would keep maybe $25k as an emergency fund which leaves you $80k. Maybe put $30k into MBA and leaves you $50k in retirement.  You're going on for your MBA, just do a forcasting model based on expect income with MBA verses Savings model.  Then factor in externalities such as increased job satisfaction and then just pick the higher number. I'd fund your 401k and save the rest. Funding it comes out pretax, so it would reduce your income (likely 25 percent marginal bracket based on what you said). That means that you're choosing between $1 in your 401k or $0.75 in your savings account.\n\nFor an MBA, use loans as needed and some of your cash, but keep a solid amount in savings for your post-MBA moving and living expenses. It's easy to fork over nearly 10k when renting an apartment in Manhattan (for example; first, last, security, commission). Your opportunity cost will be on the high side, but MBAs tend to have a solidly positive ROI for a large majority of students (in general).

The plan is to retire to lake property, and keep our current savings as emergency fund. We hope to save enough money in next ten months to pay for our wedding!\n\nSo her rich aunt lives out of town and purchased a $500k home here, we rent the upstairs for a discounted rent of $1300  with all bills included.

However, right now we're saving for our wedding and we're finding that together we can save $1000 a month. My thoughts are to stay here for a few years until we start our family and need more space.

You're getting all of the things you listed above, and it sounds like you feel like you're getting a good deal to boot.  Don't give up a good deal just to use a small portion of your overall housing expenses (the principal portion of your mortgage payment, which will be small in the early years of the loan) to build equity. I don't like how rent gets framed as throwing away money. Interest on a mortgage is throwing away money. Property tax is contributing to your community, but also in a way throwing away money. Maintenance is throwing away money. Etc.\n\nI think buying when you need to take a mortgage is kind of like paying extra to lock in the price.

I will stay with my family, so I won't have to worry about food or rent (although we may have to move to a larger house--in which case I may have to contribute because we live in NYC and rent is insane). I spend pretty modestly, although I'll have extra expenses because I'll be taking film classes/pursuing film in other ways in my free time. Also, I have no student debt (but my parents have a huge lease on a tractor-trailer). \n\nBasically, I'm assuming I'll have a lot of extra income, although I don't really know how much.

The land is listed for sale, and we\u2019ve had a few tire kickers, and even a contract that fell through, but I don\u2019t expect it to sell any time soon.\n  \nI do not need money, and would prefer to wait for the right buyer and price.

I believe the other two co-owners are more interested in selling sooner than later, again money related.  \n\nQuestion #1:   As tenants in common, we need to work together and agree on selling the land (price and timing).  So far, we\u2019re doing \u201cok\u201d, but I think there is a high likelihood that we\u2019ll reach a point where some want/need to sell quickly for under market value, and others (possibly just me?) will want to hold.

We would use that redirected money to do things like travel and home improvements, and we will need to some car replacements soon.  To accomplish this, I would decrease my 401k down to the company match level, and cease Roth contributions.   I make $155k per year, and my job is stable.  My spouse does not work.

I've been in college for about two years now. But I'll get to it. After my first semester of college I was contacted by my financial aid office at my university. Basically my mother's birthday was wrong on her forms for the financial aid. So I had to get that changed and it was. After that I was selected (randomly told by my financial aid office) to prove something about finances. Come to find out that my mother's income was input as my income. So after a few weeks I got everything done that I could on my part. I had to wait for my mother and her employer for her tax forms. It took an entire semester and due to this there was a hold placed on my account. Well after three weeks of this semester the forms all came in and when I went to speak with the financial aid dept at my school they explained that I could not enroll in courses and ended up trying to figure out anything. All the financial aid dept told me was that I could put my hold on a credit card which would be impossible for me as a 19 year old. They also told me that there maybe a way for me to take out a private loan to get this handled. The hold on my account is in the upwards of $15,000. In order for me to continue this semester I would need this loan to be taken care of in the next two months by mid March according to financial aid. My family has not been too helpful through my short time in college. So any advice would be helpful.\n\nEDIT: SO I should get a job and look at private loans. I can get a job no problem.

Well the bills for house as well as buying the house it self and paying for my brothers college fund added and added until we are now we're we are now we can't pay for anything from what I know I don't know what's going to happen in the next month homeless maybe? Who knows my parents can't pay for my brothers college anymore when I'm 18 wat are we gonna do?!?!? Also they have to pay for a lawyer for house they got fined or something 30 thousand dollars and buying a lawyer is gonna take 10 thousand and no guarantee we are gonna get the money back I'm scared shitless of what's going to happen that's why I'm here please be honest and answer these things for me . 1 no bs be honest what is most likely thing to happen to us homeless?

I don't care please tell me \n\nWhere are you located? The use of the word \"villages\" suggests to me that you aren't in the US. Likely outcomes will of course depend on where you live.\n\nYour parents may be to file bankruptcy and in some places that protects the primary family home. Again, that will be location dependent. Bankruptcy also means they won't live the rest of their lives in *this debt*, but it doesn't stop them from continuing to accumulate more debt in the future.\n\n>  I can barely get up every day and go to school \n\nThis is the one thing that you, as a 15 year old, *can* control. You can't control your parents' closed mindedness, you can't control their spending, you can't control the laws of your country on bankruptcy, but you CAN control whether you go to school or not. I HIGHLY suggest that you summon all of your will to continue doing so. When you are an adult, one thing you will look back on at this time and be thankful for is if you continued your education so that you wouldn't stay stuck in poverty for the rest of your life. It will be hard, but stick to it! Hey, well, I am 16, but that doesn't matter, Idk a lot of economies cause it isn't what I am gonna follow in my future, but look little things that I know is that, I do understand your worries, but I guess u should or talk with them about the situation, because sometimes there is some way to open their mind, hopefully there is, 2nd you aren't a adult to the law so, if your parents can't take care of you, if they don't have conditions you always can go to a reception center, I guess and finally, like I read in a comment here, just remember that your future depends on the school, so don't give up of going to school, well, I guess the best thing u can do now is focus on your studies  What you don't know is usually scarier than what you know, and right now you don't know very much. That is actually a very scary way to live. Can you confide in a teacher you like at school, or a guidance counselor? Having an outside adult to speak with can make a big difference. If you feel comfortable talking to your school librarian, they might be a great person to help you look up and understand what your family is facing. She can also help you explore social services that might be available to you or your family, as well as options for financial aid for college.\n\nYou don't say where you live, so it's hard to say for sure. But my guess is that you will not be homeless. You may end up needing to move somewhere less expensive, which might mean changing schools, but it's not homeless. If your parents really do go through bankruptcy, it can be a blessing because it can clear away a lot, or all of, the debt that's hanging over them. But ultimately that's not in your power.\n\nThe next couple of years are not going to look like what you expected, but you will get through. Take care of yourself and your health, and take it one day at a time. \n\nIt sounds like your parents are talking about things in front of you that they're not really explaining and that makes it scarier. That's not very responsible of them either.\n\nWhat's worth knowing? Many many families face bankruptcy without becoming homeless. Many kids from families who can't pay for college find ways to go to college and have great careers. Many kids whose parents were terrible at handling money do just fine on their own.\n\nIf at all possible, find an adult in your life who is sensible and trustworthy and speak with them about it. You do not have to protect your parents' privacy in this - this is your experience too and you're entitled to process it in the way that benefits you.\n\nDeep breaths. Wash your face. Hug someone you love.  Not your problem but if you want outside college help you might want to learn what a run-on sentence is.   Get a job, any job, save your money. Don't tell your parents how much you make our how much you work if you're able. That money is yours. If they can't be smart with their own money then they probably won't be any smarter with yours, adding your funds to theirs will just accustom them to having a large pool to draw from each month, so keep it.\n\nJust save and save. Having a job should help you take your mind off this, so long as you do your job well and focus. After a while you'll have a little nest egg saved up and that should help you feel a bit better. Your parents need to sort this out on their own. Short of encouraging them to be more frugal with their money and living below their means I don't believe you can really do a whole lot. \n\nSo long as they both have jobs(?) you guys should come out of this okay. Don't worry, focus on school. Your brother will likely have to take out student loans to finish college.\n\nYou will likely have to take out student loans to go to college.\n\nYour parents will likely be forced to sell one house or the other because their current lifestyle of owning and being landlords is unsustainable. That's a big burden for a 15 year old.  Sit down asap with your Mom or Dad or both and ask them to explain things to you.  Tell them what you're thinking.  I'm guessing it's not as bad as you're explaining above.\n\nWhat you've said:\n\n---They're working and still are, at least one of them, and making decent $.  Otherwise they wouldn't have recently moved up in house.\n\n---They got behind on paying something, or they got fined for something.  You're not sure what.\n\n---They can't afford to pay for your brother's college right now.  And you go to college in 2 1/2 to 3 more years.  A lot of things change in 3 years.\n\nWhat I know as a parent:\n\n---If my son or daughter came to me confused and scared about how we're surviving or paying our bills, and was scared that we'd be homeless or that they wouldn't be able to go to college, then I'd be glad they asked me about it and would explain what was going on (maybe just basically and not with lots of specifics though).\n\n---And I'd let them know where we might live if we did have to sell the house. Maybe I'd say \"this house we bought is too expensive...we'll need to sell it later this year and then rent somewhere for awhile while we save for another one\", or whatever the truth was.\n\n---And I'd talk about your college.  For what it's worth if they don't have $ for your college there are grants (gifts) available to families who don't make enough $ to afford it.  And there are part-time jobs you could also work when you're in college.\n\nYou're only 15, so ask them and get things clarified.  It sounds like you're way more worried than what the problem will likely really be. Focus on your education, you clearly need it. Todd natural selection boohoo Jesus Christ. OP doesn't know how to punctuate and people replying don't know the difference between your and you're. I'm kind of losing faith in our youth.  \n\nTo OP, learn punctuation and grammar.

I've been repairing my credit to the best of my ability(up to 620 with hopes of pushing it up more as i get things paid off and getting and using a secured card) and I have about 5k saved up with the intention of buying eventually, and im currently making about 25-27k a year, so not a tonne of money but the cost of living around here is pretty low comparatively, so I'm able to actually save compared to other cities. also have a car and a motorcycle as assets, together i would say they are worth like 6k)\n\nThe meat of my question is, Ive seen a bunch of rent-to-own houses and shortsale/forclosure houses out there with really reasonable rents/payments(6-800/m for 2-3br) which were my targets for rent anyways.

You pay for an option to purchase at the end of a (typically) 2-year or 3-year contract, during which time a percentage of each month's rent is put toward a down payment fund.

Over the last three years I opened many, and then pretty much maxed all but a few. Now, three accounts I've closed after I paid them off. That was a huge hit on my credit score, but I'm not too concerned about that right now since I have no immediate plans to make big purchases requiring good credit. In time that score will improve, especially when I've paid things off and have a better utilization rate. I just need a kick in the pants to stop being compulsive and buckle down and work on this hot mess I've spent myself into. I've stopped buying clothes I don't wear, I've stopped buying fabric for quilting projects. I have enough for many projects to finish them and want to get at least 5 of them done before even thinking about buying more fabric. I've stopped buying lattes.

If you can, I would honestly make the minimum payments on all the cards, and throw as much as you possibly can at the highest interest rate card. Amount A\n\nOnce paid off that that amount plus amount A that you were paying on the next highest rate card. Amount B\n\nTake Amount B and repeat previous steps until fully paid off. \n\nI'm not sure what your situation for work is, but is it possible to work 40+ hours? Second job or better paying job? (guessing you're at $12/hr?)\n\nBack of the napkin math is roughly 80 week pay off before interest. (I don't know if that $450 is before or after taxes) Probably closer to 2 full years after you factor that all in.  \n\nCan you sell anything you don't want or need to help. \nConsider changing your cell phone plan. Cricket has pretty good rates. I pay just over 1/2 of what you do. ($45)\n\nIn the mean time, and this might sound silly. Put index cards in your wallet, at your computer etc.. anywhere where you would go to buy something with a reminder not to do it. \n\nYour Care Credit and Amazon can be paid off 1/2 way through March.\n\n Idk if you've heard of Dave Ramsey's program, but I recommend it!! We loosely follow it. \n\nFirst step savings! Our goal is $2k, but we are a family of 3 plus pets. So maybe $500-1k for you? \n\nYou've pretty much got your money all designated it seems, so decide how much to put toward credit card payments. Then you can snowball in order of APR (highest to lowest) or balance (lowest to highest). \n\nI don't have time at the moment to sit down and write up a detailed plan but can in the morning if you haven't gotten more answers.  Breaking down the vitals:\n\n - Income: $1800/mo\n - Listed expenses (not including credit cards): $765\n - Net difference: $1,035\n\nIf this monthly surplus is accurate, you should easily be able to dedicate $1000/month towards your debt, meaning you'll be [debt free by the end of 2020](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=925&name_0=BoA%20CC&balance_0=5985.67&payment_0=100&rate_0=14.74&name_1=Citi%20CC&balance_1=1900.81&payment_1=25&rate_1=0&name_2=Chase%20CC&balance_2=2452.57&payment_2=50&rate_2=18.48&name_3=Amazon%20CC&balance_3=605.17&payment_3=50&rate_3=26.24&name_4=CareCredit&balance_4=500.87&payment_4=75&rate_4=26.99&name_5=US%20Bank%20Premiere%20CC&balance_5=2978.16&payment_5=50&rate_5=13.75&name_6=US%20Bank%20CC&balance_6=8266.85&payment_6=125&rate_6=24.49&name_7=US%20Bank%20Reserve%20CC&balance_7=2483.16&payment_7=75&rate_7=21.9&name_8=Navient%20Unsubsidized&balance_8=215.36&payment_8=50&rate_8=6.8&name_9=Navient%20Signature&balance_9=556.31&payment_9=75&rate_9=8.75&name_10=Lending%20Club&balance_10=5340.29&payment_10=250&rate_10=14.34&). If you are finding your monthly surplus is a lot less, you need to go back and figure out what you're spending money on.\n\nI'm assuming that at least some of your credit card debt is due to stuff you've bought that you still own. You should consider selling some of this stuff; even if you only get back a fraction of what you paid for it, as that'll put a decent dent in your debt and reduce how much interest you'll pay over time. Even if you only get 20% of your consumer credit card debt back in item resale (about $5,000, which doesn't include the student loans, CareCredit, or Lending Club balances), once applied to your highest interest debt you'll be out of debt a year sooner and with a lot less interest paid.\n\nThere are some things with your current expenses that need work, too. $100 per week on food, as you've mentioned, is ridiculous. Prepping large batches of food in advance (see also: /r/EatCheapAndHealthy and /r/MealPrepSunday) will not only save you money, but also save you time. You would actually be surprised at how slow getting fast food is in comparison to cooking certain types of meals. Also, since you already have a Keurig, consider getting one of those reusable cups instead of spending money on the disposable cups; you'll quickly make up the $15 or so it costs to buy the reusable cups by not spending insane amounts on the disposable cups. You should easily be able to cut your food spending by at least half by cooking yourself and switching to a reusable filter; combined with reselling your stuff, that brings back your expected debt payoff by about 6 months and about $1300 in interest.\n\nOf course, none of the above matters if you cannot [build self control](http://www.wikihow.com/Build-Self%E2%80%90Control). Part of this process is going to necessarily involve figuring out why you compulsively spend, and determining how to reduce the desire to overspend or redirect your attention to a more positive, wallet-friendly activity.\n\nAs for emergency savings, I would only consider setting aside a maximum of $1,000 until your high-interest (10%+) debt is taken care of. This should be enough to help you avoid getting into more debt, but won't be a drag on your overall debt payoff plan. Bankruptcy? You have ~$32,000 worth of credit card debt and make $450 a week.\n\nI am betting those minimum payments are eating up anything you have left after rent and food expenses. Looks like you've got appx $32K in credit cards / Lending Club, and $800 in student loans.  And you're only making $22K/year or so.\n\nTwo solutions I see.  Choose one:\n\n-1-  Get a 2nd job or a higher paying new job, and then make sure every cent of the $ increase goes toward your debts.  You're living at home and making $22k/year.  That living at home thing is fine for now, but what about in 3 years or so?  And making only $22k/year won't help you put a decent dent in that debt.  OR...\n\n-2-  Declare Chapter 7 bankruptcy if you're young.  You'll wipe out all but  that student loan $, and maybe even some of that.  It will probably cost you appx $1,000 in lawyers fees to do that though, and your credit will be messed up for 7 years...but it's probably already messed up.\n\nChoose #2 if you can't start making more $ really soon.

Paying off the house early is like locking in 2.75% return on the extra cash.   One other thing, contact your credit union and see if they have a better rate for the car. If you can get that to the 2% rate, you could make those payments and invest the capital instead of paying off the car. Vehicles don't retain their value very well, so you'd lose a lot of money on that investment really quickly. I'd look for a used car for a MAXIMUM of $10,000, pay it all upfront in cash, and use the extra money you would have spent toward paying off the mortgage early. The money you'd save would be almost a full year in payments on the mortgage depending on the car you get. Read the sidebar, including READ THIS FIRST flowcharts.\n\nOption Number 3: Pay-off the car in full if you have to have it. Optimally, do not buy-out the lease and drive a more reasonable used car (thinking 3 year old used 4 door Honda or Toyota Sedan) for much cheaper. Use the remainder to aggressively save for retirement in the market (more on this below). \n\nMy other suggestion is to not  to aggressively pay-down the mortgage. Unless this provides emotional security. It isn't wise financially. Instead you should be saving for retirement. I suggest you at least get any employer match. In addition, you should be maxing out an IRA (either Roth or Traditional depending on facts) with Vanguard. I suggest dumping this in a Target Date Fund based on your retirement date or an allocation of stocks/bonds based on age. Keeping 110 less your age in stocks and the rest in bonds. Splitting each 70/30 domestic and international using the Vanguard core index fund. See links below.\n\nThis advice is due to the fact that the after-tax advantage cost of your mortgage is WAY LESS than what you will get out of the market over a long-term. It is financially irrational to do early pay-down. You can easily expect 6% out of the market compared to 2.75% less the tax benefit if you itemize. \n\nhttps://investor.vanguard.com/mutual-funds/target-retirement/#/\n\nhttps://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/vanguard/core; In March 2009, before the crash, the S&P 500 was at 1561.

I'd recommend setting things up so that the studio is somewhat separated from the house (external door with access to the studio, separate lockable door that excludes the studio from the rest of the house).   2000 isn't really much for a home studio. What equipment did you buy? What skills do you have? Why did you buy the equipment to begin with? That will be relevant for finding a way to make money....more than the equipment itself.  Home recording studios can be a bit difficult to make money from. You need to start off creating with the bare minimum and then go from there. My advice is don't just jump in the deep end. The music industry is heavily oversaturated and can be both expensive to get into and difficult to get returns. You also have to think of your customer market. Do they have money for a small studio that is enough to cover your bills and expenses. Would they better off just using their personal macbook and a $100 sm58 microphone? Have a look for other studios in your local area and see what services they offer. This will give you an indication on how useful another studio would be. $2000 in my opinion is not a great studio, especially if youre hiring it.

You tax return is the form you fill out and send in to the IRS. You probably received a 1099. >I was unaware that taxes were not being taken out of each paycheck.\n\nHow did you not notice these were not listed on your pay stubs? Did they send you a 1099? If so then yes you're technically an independent contractor. I'm sorry you must have misunderstood them. To have taxes taken out you would have filled out paperwork claiming how many dependents you wanted. You had a received a check each time you were paid with the break down of exactly how much was taken out and where it went. Then you would have received a W2 at the end of the year.  Did you know you were being considered a contractor not a regular full time employee?  Even if you dispute your classification (as an independent contractor vs. an employee), you are still going to need to pay income tax. People can't just not pay income tax. You may be able to negotiate a payment plan with the government, but you will have to pay interest on that like any other loan.\n\nNext year, you should pay closer attention to the paperwork related to your job and your pay, so there are no surprises. Did you fill out a w-4 when you started? You must have more deduction than that. If you drove to work you can deduct gas mileage and car. If you stayed home you can deduct office space, internet, heating.. etc... Also deduct 30%of you phone bill.

I dont think you can legally transfer title if the mortgage is still going to be in your name.  \n\n> What's the least painful/costly way to do this? Best way to avoid capital gains tax? How can I avoid pissing off the IRS?\n\nI do estate/gift planning.  If you gift the property to him, you will not be subject to capital gains tax.  The property will transfer to him with a carryover basis (i.e. what ever your basis in the property is).  Now, if you wait until you pass away, the property will get a step up in basis to fair market value on the date of death.  If you sell the property to him, the difference between FMV and the sales price will be a gift.  If you sell it for FMV then you will be subject to capital gains.  However, you will be allowed to exclude $250K of gain ($500K if married) if the property is you principle residence.  \n\nAgain, per first comment I made, I dont think you can transfer title if it is encumbered by a mortgage still in your name.  based on the mortgage and the possible step up, I would think your best course is to transfer it upon death.   I don't know anything about your finances, but your son could rate/term refinance your home & mortgage into his name. At least one, and possibly two, niche Fannie Mae guideline things are at play here, and you or your son will have to dial for dollars until you find a lender familiar with both. \n\n* [Children wanting to provide housing for their parents](https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide/selling/b2/1/01.html). This will give your son a killer 30YF interest rate on his mortgage without him having to actually owner occupy. (Run from anyone suggesting that your son automatically \"MUST\" use investor financing)\n\n* [Fannie Mae removed continuity of obligation for rate/term refinances about a year ago](https://www.fanniemae.com/content/guide/selling/b2/1.2/04.html), meaning your son doesn't have to be on title for 6 or 12 months to refinance your mortgage into his name.\n\nYou probably don't want to be anyone's \"beta test,\" so I strongly suggest dialing for dollars until you find a lender already familiar with one or both of the above. It should be relatively easy:\n\n* \"Hey LO Sally, will my son get anything special if he's taking out a mortgage on a home in order to provide housing for me, his older father?\" - if they are familiar with and qualified to use that guideline, they will get very excited and be like \"OH SINCE YOU ASKED....\"\n\n* \"Hey Mortgage Broker Jane, without taking the time to type in a google search, can you please spell the word 'continuity' for me?\" - basically, same as above.\n\nNiche guideline things like this function as a magical spell. You invoke the magic words when speaking with underwriting, and the borrower gets a slam dunk deal. It is not underwriting's job to structure transactions, so they rarely offer suggestions, even if it's one that fits within such-and-such criteria, because then they have to go back and re-underwrite it a second time after it's restructured (working for free).\n\nCall 10 lenders tomorrow, post back with results!\n\nNow, a few things you also should also keep in mind.\n\n* Your son may want to buy his own house some day. If he has an ownership interest in the house you live in, he will not be eligible for any state/local FTHB programs, as he is not a FTHB per the standard /r/realestate industry definition of \"first time home buyer\" (the IRS has a different definition that he might still fall under, which has implications for deducting some of his closing costs when he purchases his personal home). These state/local FTHB programs aren't nearly as knock-your-socks off amazing as they were in years past, but I cannot predict what the future will bring! Further, his debt-to-income ratio might be impacted in a way that's a deal-killer for his personal home purchase. For both of these, whoever the LO was that could spell the word \"continuity\" will be able to go over those things with you and your son (f.ex. maybe his wife's income is sufficient for them to purchase their house, just in her name?).\n\n* Rope in a RE lawyer to make sure the above is on the up and up and inform you of any caveats that might come up. Technically as a LO I could do the whole thing myself, but we receive very little training in legal/title issues, so I can't tell you what caveats might come up because \"I don't know, what I don't know.\"\n\n* Rope in your tax professional to talk about tax consequences. Again, as a loan originator, \"I don't know, what I don't know.\" In my experience people want to give away their property to avoid inheritance taxes and/or make themselves eligible for public assistance in the event they need skilled care, etc. You have a couple problems here. If you transfer for less than fair market value while you're alive your son will get a \"carry over cost basis\" meaning he when he sells his capital gains will be based on the difference between your purchase price and his sale price. If you give it to him when you die he gets a stepped up cost basis and probably 0 capital gains. Even if you're sure you won't get evicted there is always the danger your son could end up with some uninsured liability that would result in the forfeiture of your home for his debt. If you son is married there is always the danger of divorce where his spouse has an interest in all property acquired during marriage and ... you lose your house. As far as I know most States have a look back period for public assistance when assets are conveyed away for less than fair market value. This is far from a complete answer; just wanted to let you know what you propose is not a straight forward transaction. You should talk with 2 people, an attorney and an accountant. If this is for medicare purposes, you should speak with a lawyer with expertise in the area. \n\nIf your wife isn't your son's mother, and this is for protecting his interests, you should speak with a marriage/divorce lawyer about a postnuptial. \n\nDo you have enough funds sitting somewhere to finish up the mortgage, or would you need to pay off over time?\n\nAs long as there's a mortgage, it's not really yours to give or transfer - the bank has an interest and can impose restrictions. You could talk to your bank about whether the mortgage could be refinanced to your son but with you as guarantor, or something like that, but do keep in mind that this could restrict him later in ways he might not appreciate.\n\nOverall, I think you need to be clear on exactly what you want to accomplish and why (and maybe you are but not sharing it here) and then seek appropriate legal/financial advice from someone with a fiduciary duty to you.

But in that extreme case who knows if cash will even be useful anymore. I keep 100 dollars for this type of reason. I have smart relatives who keep $1,000 in a safe but I think that's far too much. That amount could be earning returns somewhere else.  I have a few hundred bucks stashed for when I don't want to run to the bank.\n\nBut I wouldn't keep thousands or anything like that. My opinion, if you have a bolted down really good quality safe... $1000, in case you need cash and your atm card has a limit like mine of $500 per day.\n\nIf your only safe is a cheap suitcase type, throw $100 for ease of access to a bit of cash but then hide another $900 somewhere you won't forget but a burglar wouldn't find. Note: Email yourself a hint when you hide it so you can look it up in your email if you forget.\n\nNext level after that, local credit union / bank (look at rates).\n\nNext level after that, online credit union or bank (again knock at rates) that way it takes a few days to pull out. This helps in case you tend to make rash decisions and hopefully the delay in getting your funds makes you rethink your purchase.\n\nI also have CD's laddered and most of the rest (retirement) at an online brokerage (Vanguard / Fidelity). I imagine having $100 stashed at home would be good in case you ever lose your wallet or something. No, there is no significant benefit from doing this; just keep some petty cash in your wallet for convenience. If you're worried about post-apocalyptic survival, you should stockpile non-perishable food and other actually valuable goods, not cash.  I keep a couple hundred dollars in random hiding spots in my room as a \"just in case\" type deal. I wouldn't store thousands and thousands of dollars - it's less safe and you gain nothing from storing it there whereas you can put it in a bank account where it is insured and can also grow with interest. If there's any real advantage I don't see it. If you just park cash in a safe it earns you nothing, and it's definitely not safer than if you put it in the bank. \n\nCash just depreciates in value over time, and even in a safe it's still more likely to be lost or stolen than if you had it in a bank account.  Nope. Don't do it. A good safe will cost more than the little bit of money you'd want to keep in it. Savings accounts are fully insured. Unless you're really concerned about the banking system collapsing, but in that apocalyse case you've got bigger troubles. Keep in mind, safes aren't fireproof.  Further, keep in mind fireproof safes aren't fireproof.  \n\nSafes get an Underwriter Laboratories rating based on the temperature of the fire and the length of time they're expected to survive.  Paper being one of the most fragile things you can protect from fire requires a pretty high rating - something like Class 350 - 2 hour.  \n\nSure, it could be nice to have a bunch of cash at home since savings accounts have such poor interest rates.

Tennessee does not tax wages.  W VA, PA, and Indiana have a reciprocal tax agreement with Ohio that exempts Ohio residents from tax on wages.\n\nThat leaves Arkansas as the oddball.  It appears that the employer's payroll system still has him listed as a resident.  You were receiving paychecks for a whole year with Arkansas taxes withheld and didn't think to call this to the attention of your employer?\n\nYou will have to file an Arkansas non-resident income tax return, Form AR1000NR to claim a refund.  Arkansas may just send you a refund or they may reply asking for additional documentation.  States are usually skeptical of claims that employer randomly withheld taxes for the wrong state.  All you can do is submit a return and then reply promptly to any correspondence you receive.  If you move anytime in the next 5 years, be sure to promptly notify the Arkansas DFA of your new address.\n\nAnd, of course, since you are residents of Ohio, you have to file Ohio resident income tax returns.  (Don't forget to file local income tax  returns, if applicable.)  If your husband didn't have any Ohio income tax withheld, you may face a penalty for underpayment of taxes.\n\nA corrected W-2 won't help, since the money has already been sent to Arkansas and your employer probably cannot get it back.\n\n You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Tax Software Megathread](http://redd.it/5ohy01)\n- [Taxes wiki page](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes)\n- [Understanding tax brackets](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/taxes#wiki_eli5.3A_taxable_income.2C_tax_brackets.2C_marginal_tax_rates)\n- [W-4 IRS Withholding Calculator](http://www.irs.gov/Individuals/IRS-Withholding-Calculator)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

I max out my 401K with employer matching funds @3%; the rest pretty much goes into my bank account.\n\nI have accumulated about $100K in cash.

It's a mindset issue.  Even a catastrophic situation, like a 2008, became the single greatest wealth building opportunity for people who simply chose to continue investing at an ordinary rate.  The only people who were hurt were those who (1) sold / cashed out / switched to conservative bond funds or (2) were in single stocks.  That's it.  Everyone else made buckets of money.

I've been following personal finance for awhile and have liked and applied a number of things I've read, including How to handle $ which I hope you'll see I've taken to heart :).\n\nBackground on myself: \nmid 20's guy, work in sales, live in a very high cost of living metro area, live with the girlfriend, pretty stereotypical millennial lifestyle/spending habits. Grew up just below the poverty line so a lot of what I'm hoping to discuss/learn is very new to me. Risk Lover, at least when it's something that I feel my knowledge can influence. For example, I don't like to gamble in vegas or majorly on cards etc, but I do enjoy speculative investing on volatile stocks and betting on sports that I have knowledge of. \n\nFinancial Background:\n\n\n-Was broke during college so ended up with a few delinquent payments on my credit - paid all those off and negotiated most being removed, but still, a few show up. Credit rating is rising but currently around 750 most rating systems (based on what Creditkarma, what BofA provides, etc.)\n\n-Work for a software company that provides good 401k (1:1 match up til a point, which I max out, then lower my contribution) and good ESPP (Can contribute up to 15% of income, which I max out as well)\n\n-Recently (within the last year) started to invest via Robinhood, have about 20k in there and have performed relatively well after a couple hiccups, overall still in the black. \n\n-As someone in sales I try and for the most part do live off my base salary, I save my commission and use it for large purchases (gift for GF, experiences, my car, etc.)\n\nFinancial obligations:\n\n1.4k/mo for rent\n\n300-500/mo to support family member\n\nno cell phone or car payments. gym is covered by work, etc.\n\n10k in student loans, but I paid off all the bad/high interest ones. \n\nFinancial assets:\n20k in Robinhood, 50k in employee stock  \n50k in 401k which my employer will give me a loan   \nVehicle with re-sell value approx 30k  \n50k in savings\n\nQuestions:  \n1) should I get a financial advisor? I've always seen them as a waste of money unless you have 100s of thousands to invest. I also love micromanaging the financial aspects of my life, but if it really is a better way to go, I would have to listen to reason.\n\n2) I fall into the 33% federal tax bracket, anything I should think about to alleviate this? Seeing this+ SS on my tax return hurts. \n\n3) I really want to buy a house. All the above financial assets, for the most part, have been accumulated in the last 18 months. due to a couple promotions, I can say with confidence that conservatively I can double all of them in the next 12-18 months. I have always heard there are really good first-time homeowners tax breaks. Should I wait to try to buy a more expensive house so I can take further advantage of these tax breaks? \n\n4) If the answer is no, and I should buy a house in the next 12-18 months? Should I buy a house to live in, or should I buy a house to rent? I'm not sure I plan to stay where I am long term, but at least for the next 4-5 years. I'm completely impartial, just want to do what makes the most financial sense. Part of me wants to buy in an up and coming market vs. one that is already extremely high. If I do buy, should I 100% buy something I can put 20% toward, or would it be OK to do 10-15%? \n\n5) When thinking about semi-liquid assets, should I consider some of the money from my 401k? I read you can take a loan from your employer on I believe 20k of it. Is this a good idea? \n\n6) since I do like to micromanage $ and I am Risk-Loving, I plan to put more $ into robinhood. past year moving 2k/month in was a trial that performed well enough that I'm thinking about ramping that up to 5k/month. Good or bad idea?\n\n7) Are there other questions I should be asking? \n\ntl dr starting to gain some financial assets, want to buy a house, not sure how I should be maximizing said assets.

As a side note, if you love micro-managing there's no reason to NOT pay off your student loans. It's $10k which you could pay off in a month.\n\n2) Add more deductions. But your income is your income. You can't \"beat\" wherever your income tax falls other than taking as many deductions as you can (of which I believe a house would be an add'l one).\n\n3) House -- find a house that can you can make a home. It sounds cheesy, but if you're truly looking for a home to live in, I would suggest you think of it that way. Let's say you double your savings and you have $150k conservatively that's 3/4 million dollar house at 20% downpayment. So if you live in the bay area that may not get you exactly the type of house you want, but is nothing to scoff at either. \n\n4) Some of these questions (for me at least) are solved by non-financial answers. If I were in your situation I wouldn't buy in that high COL unless you have a couple hundred grand to put down.\n\n5) By this point in your questions you're starting to get more levered so I would suggest not taking a loan out against your retirement. \n\n6) All about risk averseness. There isn't a clear financial black or white answer. You're in the black now, but you could lose half of it over the next year. Would you be comfortable with that?\n\n7) What are your retirement goals? For me that's question numero uno. Then you can back everything else out like play funds, real estate, etc. So let's say you want a little over $300k/year (I'm guessing you make more than that now) that's ~$8m or so in retirement at 4% withdrawal. Back out what you need to save each year until you retire, then look at your disposable income again and map out how risk averse you are and invest accordingly.\n\n ", "date": 1483257600.0, "upvotes": 1, "flair": "New to having disposable income, looking for advice on the best way to capitalize on it"}{"body": "I'm sorry if a similar question has been answered before but I have been scouring the internet trying to find it and have been unsuccessful.\n\nI'll try to keep this short.

She never profited anything from this home. Not while we were there while it was in her name and not when it was sold as she gave the money to us.

Your deductions lower the amount of income and your income determines how much you owe in taxes.  No, you can deduct the interest you paid. Meaning you don't pay taxes on it. The government doesn't pay your student loan interest for you. A deduction of any kind reduces your taxable income, subject to eligibility rules and income phase-outs.\n\nA deduction is not a dollar-for-dollar repayment. You do not get refunded for interest paid on student loans. You deduct the interest which means you're not taxed on the interest. That's it. I think you're confusing deductions with __credits__. The education credits you may have received while in school are dollar-for-dollar and increase your refund or decrease your amount owned by the exact amount of the credit. Same is true with the child tax credit, earned income credit and some others. A __deduction__ decreases your taxable income. As a simplified example: Say your adjusted gross income is $20,000, a $2,500 (the maximum) student loan interest deduction would decrease your taxable income to $17,500 and you would be taxed on that. Say you're being taxed at 10%, that would decrease your tax by $250.

We currently have $14,000 in savings towards our down payment on top of $3,000 in savings for emergencies.  I currently earned loan forgiveness for over half my student loans that brought my total student loan debt down to $13,000.  This means we could pay off all my student loan debt right now, but it would eliminate almost all of our savings for a house.\n\nIn an ideal situation we would save 20% down (this would probably take another year) and then buy our house.  The area we are looking in has houses around $200,000 to $220,000.  Our priority when getting a house is to have a low monthly payment, so we are trying to avoid any 3% down mortgage situations.  This would be our first house, so we know there are some additional mortgage offers there, but all the ones we have found have higher monthly payments.\n\nThings we are trying to consider are ... if we pay off my student loans, we have no debt (our cars are payed for and we pay off our credit cards in full each month).  Interest rates for mortgages are supposed to go up, and the highest interest rate I have on one of my student loans is 6.55%.  If we don't pay them off all at once, we will use the avalanche method to pay them off using the full monthly payment we did before the forgiveness went through.\n\nWe have also had a family member offer to help us with the down payment (a sort of gift/loan combo that we could pay back over several years).  We aren't opposed to this idea, but we aren't in love with it either, especially if it ends up being more of a loan situation because loans among family members tend to cause tension.\n\nSo is it better to pay off the student loans and have no debt?  Is it better to get a house before mortgage interest rates are raised again?", "title": "Buy a house or pay off student loans?", "comments": "> So is it better to pay off the student loans and have no debt? \n\nYes\n\n> Is it better to get a house before mortgage interest rates are raised again?\n\nDon't fall into this trap. Buy a house only when your finances are in order. I would personally pay off the student loan debt first, especially at 6.5%. I would boost your emergency fund up to $7-10K or so, and save 20% down. Your HH income can have a big impact on what's the best strategy though. I would pay off the loans with interest rates over 5%. Then when that is done, I would just make the minimum payments on the loans and use all surplus money to save up for the downpayment.  This is a risk / reward question, but my personal preference would be to pay off the student loans first so you don't have than hanging over your head.\n\nYes... you *might* be able to pull off the mortgage and start building equity in a home at a lower interest rate than what would pay for a mortgage in a year or two... but what happens if you or your SO get laid off? What if a big health expense came out of nowhere and you had to shell out a bunch of cash?\n\nThere are so many things that can happen in life that could throw a wrench into any well thought out plans, and it's always safer to not owe people money.\n\nI would:  \n1 \u2013 Pay off your debt  \n2 \u2013 Work HARD to save up money again (do online jobs on Upwork.com or Fiverr.com)  \n3 \u2013 Maybe get a 2nd job that's 100% remote (see RemoteOK.io or Jobspresso.co)  \n4 \u2013 Keep your costs low while you're saving money, buy in bulk  \n5 \u2013 THEN get back to your plan to buy a house  \n\nJust my 2 cents. Something i didn't consider when i started saving for a house (and something nobody mentioned to me) was closing costs. Just fyi but for a 200k house you'll have to likely pay somewhere between 4 and 8k in fees on top of your down payment for closing. The economics of the case will argue for loan repayment, as least for those with interest rates higher than, say, 3 or 4 %.  Have you considered that?  You might and see what that does.  But 13K isn't an unreasonable amount to owe especially given you have no other debt.\n\nYou do not mention your income, or how much you are saving per month.  How many months will to take you get to 50K (to cover down payment and closing?) including that gift/low interest loan?\n\nNo one can predict where mortgage rates are going. \n\nI suggest looking at a middle ground, where you pay the loans with the highest rates now and see what that does to the outlook for accumulating the down payment\n\n Pay off the debt.  The feeling of weight off your shoulders can't be bought.  Your friends will think you are weird for not having debt.   Be weird. I was in a similar situation, I think it really depends on the situation of the housing market. I invested roughly 10k for 5% down (so I have a PMI), and the house has gone up about 35k in a year. In my situation it was better to buy a house than pay off my student loans which were 6% for the higher ones.\n\nYou also need to factor rent, utilities, and maintenance costs into your decision. Sure I am paying HOA fees, PMI, and interest, but I am also paying principal on the loan. If you are not currently paying rent (living with parents or whatever) then you may want to consider staying there until your loans are paid off before buying. I was paying rent which was $200 less than my mortgage + HOA + utilities cost, so for me, it made sense to purchase a home. What everybody else said, plus, if you pay off your student loans first, that's one less minimum payment you have to deal with, so it'll free up money to use elsewhere. \n\nAs for the house thing, make sure you save enough for a down payment + closing costs (4k-7kish) + have enough for an emergency fund.  >Our priority when getting a house is to have a low monthly payment, so we are trying to avoid any 3% down mortgage situations. \n\nInterest rates after a very long period of stagnation are starting to rise again; if they rise another percent in the year or two you're thinking of waiting, and you take a 30 year fixed loan, that's a lot of money, up to $41K over the life of the mortgage.  (Calculated example was: $200000 principal, 30 year fixed loan at either 3.5% or 4.5%).\n\nSince you want to own, live in, and maintain a house instead of renting, buying a house has an \"imputed\" value to you that is difficult to quantify.  Unless you could rent the same place you're thinking of buying for less than $800 a month, I think this 'imputed value' tips the calculation in favor of continuing to repay the student loans on schedule and pulling the trigger on the house ASAP, maybe with an FHA loan or other low-down-payment option.  \n\nYou don't mention if you itemize deductions.  If you do, the interest part of your housing cost becomes tax-deductible, whereas there is a hard cap on the deduction for student loan interest; this makes the calculation a no-brainer, you must buy the house in this case. This is a bit off from your original question, but be aware that the lender will look at all your bank accounts/debts when making the loan decision. If a family member gifts/lends you money the lender will ask where it came from and some \"proof\" that it isn't a loan(if it isn't). If it is a loan don't expect to be able to use that money as part of your down payment. We had the same issue buying our first home with a $10k wedding present we got from family, but the lender was satisfied with a notarized letter saying it was a gift not to be repaid.

A basic blanket will do.\n\nYou don't need booties, socks, 100 clothing..mainly because you want to be able to change diaper as easily as possible.\n\nDay baby is home, sign up for a 529 and put 100 bucks in it.  Post and mail this out to your family and ask them if they want to contribute, send it to the 529.\n\nBe ready to fight the hospital on the bill. Ask for the itemized bill and cross out what was not done.  Alot of times, they go off a script and don't always go over 1 by 1 what was done, just what was normally done.\n\nFor daddy, bring a pack of sleeping pills and a pack of tylenol.  Hospital will not provide you this.  You WILL need sleep and you will be so amped you may not get any.  Headache soon ensues.\n\nYou don't need a pacifier.  Not needed till there 6 weeks or so.\n\nA personal note, make sure mommy RESTS.  No running out, no fetching stuff, no picking up stuff.  Make her be bedbound because she needs time to recover.  She just pushed a human out of her body.  Fetching stuff is your job.  \n\nKeep the house warm.  Some object to this but I pumped my temperature to 76.  Its easier to keep baby warm, and it helps to keep mommy warm. You can drop it a degree per week till your at normal (it also helps when transferring baby from swaddle to clothing as the home isn't cold while they are sitting there naked).\n\nKeep visitors to a minimum for the first 2 or 3 days as baby and mommy need to rest.. you do to.\n\nNo major purchases or construction projects.\n\nAssuming mommys 4 months in.. I'd save every penny you have.  Pay minimum payments on EVERYTHING and just sock every cent into your savings account.  Once mommy and baby are home safe, and you have your basics, use the cannon of cash you have and clear off any excess debts or use it to start up the 529 or deal with any financials such as the probably need for daycare.\n\n(BIG TIP).  Search out 4 daycares in your area and get on their waiting lists TODAY.  Some have a year or two long waitlist (yes people who don't even have kids are on their waitlist).  DO NOT WAIT ON THIS GO DO IT NOW.  If you don't decide to go that route after baby is born, you only lost 25 bucks being on the list.\n\nDO THE DAYCARE CRAP NOW. Visit, get their names, do the tour, get on their list.\n\nDO THIS SHIT NOW.\n\nYou can save on daycare by creating a dependent fsa, which you can route 5 grand pre tax and use it for daycare and nanny stuff. I know everyone says buy diapers now but you may want to wait. Some kids have allergies to diapers and some diapers you may not like. I hated Huggies and honest diapers. I like pampers and targets brand up and up(which is very cheap so bonus!). Same with wipes I only like huggies brand and it's the only brand that doesn't give my daughter a rash. The thing I'd buy now is used baby clothes. No point in New they grow so fast and ruin them anyways! I bought all my daughters clothes used and she's 20 months now and I have spent only $100 for clothes. Don't buy a expensive diaper bag either just buy a backpack! Any will do.Also bassinets are usually a waste I haven't seen many babies who actually sleep in them(mine hates it) we used a rock n play instead or she slept in my arms until she was 3 months and moved to her crib. Also visit similac and emfamil website they send free samples of all their formula so if you formula feed you have options without buying one of each and wasting money. We used similac sensitive for a month and it was costing too much($125 a month) we switched to up an up(targets brand) sensitive formula and it worked great and seemed the exact same and was only $60 a month! I am expecting baby # 2 in April and have everything he will need for the first year of his life. Here is what I did:  \n  \n- Bought diapers at Target when they had their AWESOME diaper deal (happens once a year - just happened a couple weeks ago). Basically got 6 big boxes of diapers for about $15 each(this time around - last year did the same thing). We have enough diapers to last baby until he's a year or older (I am doing half cloth and half disposable - already have cloth diapers I got on Amazon on sale).  \n  \n- Have been buying formula since before we got pregnant. Have enough for at least the first 6 months of his life and since he should start with solids (blended food) around that age we should have more than enough formula to last until his first birthday at this point (I get 1 can of formula a month from Amazon). It works out because I now know I am unable to breastfeed where as for my son I planned on breastfeeding but that just didn't happen.  \n  \n- Bought a bassinet on Amazon Warehouse for 1/4 of the price - we just set it up now and it's brand-spanking-new and awesome!  \n  \n- Got his car seat, a double stroller, and play yard for free on Amazon using cash back from one of our credit cards. SUPER helpful as these things are very expensive.  \n  \n- I still had a ton of clothes from my son so we didn't need to purchase many items for this baby except for months 3-9 as apparently my son was a messy baby and a lot of his clothes were stained. I donated these and have been slowly buying new items for my son (I don't like used clothes - so this isn't for everyone). Also kept my son's crib so we have that covered but we did buy it on Amazon for 1/3 of the price.  \n  \n- I also have a savings account for just my kids where I put in $20/week since my oldest son was born to use to buy things they want or need. Like any gear (new car seat because he outgrew his or new stroller), activities (annual pass to the zoo, soccer camp, swimming lessons, etc), or whatnot. This is not saving for their future though - that will happen once we pay off our student loans and fully fund our retirement accounts. We still have $3000 in this account that we keep adding money into weekly.\n  \n- Also stockpiled on wipes. There's a bunch leftover from when my son used them (up until August when he turned 3 and was potty trained) from Amazon so we have mooooore than enough!  \n  \n- We also have over $500 in Amazon gift cards that we have been saving for the past year from Christmas gifts as well as our Amazon credit card cash back. We will use this for all of the \"want\" items in my baby registry that no one buys for us. I din't know if you get gift cards for birthdays/Christmas but if you do I would save them!  \n  \n- Since we already have a little boy that goes to daycare we have budgeted for putting our new baby in daycare as well and have that covered with our salaries. However you should definitely do your research on daycares in the area and get as much info as you can - what age do they accept infants? What's the full time weekly cost? What do you need to provide? How far in advance should you enroll? We use an in-home daycare that our son LOVES (which makes me feel better) that is extremely inexpensive for our city - so we got lucky!  \n  \n- Toys R Us has a baby clearance going on **RIGHT NOW** - if you run to one of their stores today you may still be able to get a good deal on strollers or car seats (if they still have them!) So.... GO NOW!!!  \n  \n- Depending on how far along your wife is I recommend getting the baby's room ready now and/or baby's play area. Our son has taken over our entire home (of course) but we have set up a babies-only zone for the new baby. There is a lot of cool ideas on Pinterest - maybe your wife can look into this so that by the time you baby gets here it's is all said and done!  \n  \n- Things you don't *need*: Bassinet, crib, new clothes, new toys (make sure you sanitize used toys), bottle sanitizer, bottle drying rack, wipe warmer, bottle warmer, diaper bag (big purse works fine), expensive baby carrier, fancy stroller, chew jewelry, among others. These are not *necessary* but personally I have all of them anyway (except bottle sanitizer - don't want this time around).  \n  \n- Definitely make sure you and/or your wife get a hospital bag ready (today). Another poster mentioned what is needed in this and I agree with all - SUPER helpful for mama in the hospital.  \n  \n- CALL YOUR INSURANCE! Make sure you know what your deductible is for both vaginal and cesarian deliveries, hospital stay, as well as your Out Of Pocket maximum. This is **very** important! Also ask about your newborn baby and if s/he will be covered as soon as they are born as well as *what* is covered. Also schedule a visit to the hospital where your wife will be giving birth (usually done a month or 2 before she is due but earlier can't hurt)  \n  \n- Locate a pediatrician for your baby before s/he is born! Meet with them before-hand just to make sure you like him/her.  \n  \nGosh this is long. I probably have more info but can't think of it right now. Hope this helps OP!! Don't buy anything until you actually need it, and buy what you can secondhand.\n\nI found we never actually used/needed a stroller, Jolly Jumper, baby walker, motorised bouncy chair, etc. People will make you feel that your kid is missing out, but they only really need a safe home, nutrition, and love :-) \n\nAdditionally, you don't *need* professional baby photography, the latest toys and clothes, big birthday parties or anything like that. Those are personal choices, and I'm yet to see a baby complain about which choices were made. All those things are really for the parents benefit, and I found it less stressful to save the money and revel in my financial stability!  Start buying diapers now, if you plan to use disposable. You can never have enough, and size 3 has been the most used, or longest used.  Buy everything used except a car seat. Your kid isn't going to care if their clothes are second hand and have a small stain. They're not going to care if their toys aren't brand new. Just clear them well first. Your kid doesn't need every new thing under the sun.\n\nMake sure you're saving sufficiently for retirement first before you even think about saving for your kid. If you're worried about not into the red, you're nowhere near ready to save for your kid. For gifts, it depends on what you want the money to go to.\n\nSome hospitals are also starting to give out baby boxes if you take a short education class (I think at least parting intending to help prevent SIDS). Start getting diapers now, as well as formula if the baby will be bottle-fed. If breast, depending on what trimester the mother is in start stocking up and freezing breastmilk. DO NOT buy a used crib, bassinet, or car seat. Not worth the risk.\nIt won't hurt to have sensitive baby wipes, or sensitive, dye free clothes detergent. \nThe earlier you stock up on things you know you'll need, the more funds you'll have floating when the little one is born; in the first few months, that rainy day fund will be a godsend. Canada, USA or Other?\n\nIn Canada there is a registered education savings plan. Winners had good new baby items.\n\nA travel system is nice it's the car seat + the car dock + stroller. It's fast to transition and move your kid. \n\nIf you have lots of friends and family who love babies you can seriously cut back on the clothes from 0 to 6 months. It's the cutest so people buy plenty of then for you.\n\nDiapers vary in fit. Try a few different brands till you find one you like.\n\nSleep now while you can. I'd really look hard into cloth diapers. I know it sounds gross and I didn't like the idea at first when my wife brought it up but we've saved so much money doing it. Also I think our son finds them much more comfortable and we've never had a \"blow out\" using them. \n\nAlso, as a fellow Papa, I highly recommend breast feeding and did everything I could to make sure my wife was as comfortable and stress free as possible when she started feeding. Once again money is saved but that pales in comparison to how good it is for both mother and child. I would research this and discuss it with the mother. Formula has come a long way but still falls short. \n\nYou are a lucky man, it's worth every second.  If someone in the family is willing to host a baby shower, accept. New parents can clean up on shower gifts, often receiving several hundred dollars of necessary items.\n\nCheck out Amazon Family program as well.\n\nHold off on the \"OMGCUTENESS buying if at all possible. Especially the complex baby outfits. Seriously, if it has more than 3 snaps, you're not going to want to fool with it. If it doesn't have easy diaper access, don't bother. Also buttons suck.\n\nInsurance covers breast pumps *for now*. Get one asap. Most def. Also more and more places are accommodating  breast feeding and I think it is awesome. We went to and Oktoberfest in Georgia last year that had a \"lactation lounge.\" How awesome is that? Unlimited Hefeweizen and private breast feeding within walking distance!

I would look for a low hour part-time job (~5-10 hours per week, depending on your schedule).  Don't try to work too much, as you can overwhelm yourself between school and work, but working a few hours a week can help you build up savings for the following years.\n\nI suggest looking for jobs on campus first (many places on campus will let you study in your downtime, plus they offer flexible schedules).  As you get farther into your studies, you might want to consider tutoring, as you can usually set your own rate and schedule.  \n\nUnrelated to work- learn how to cook for yourself.  It's usually cheaper to live off campus and commute in, so learning how to make a delicious lunch can save you $7-$10 every day if you decide to move away from campus in later years.

First figure out which ones you will actually need. I found that some professors \"required\" textbooks, but they ended up just being reference material (rare, but it happened). Next, if you determine a book to be necessary for class, check to see if the library has it at your school. If it doesn't, see if a previous edition of the text will suffice, see if there is a friend in the class who wants to split the cost of one book, buy the book used, etc. Basically, don't take your shiny new book list to the campus bookstore and buy the newest textbooks you can find- it's just a waste of money!

That's a long story (you can read my posts in r/divorce if you look at my submission history. Divorce sets me back at least 10 years as far as retirement is concerned. That's obviously not something I planned for and I'm finding it difficult to make a serious financial move since I'm terrified I'll make a rash decision and make matters worse. Although I'm much better now - emotionally speaking, I'm still not sure if I'm equipped at this particular moment to make clear-headed, logical fiscal moves and hope the r/personalfinance community can help give me some clarity. So here is my situation:\n\n- I'm 43, 21 years into my career. Had intended to retire after 30+/- years. \n\n- I have 2 daughters 12 and 14.\n\n- My career is rewarding but grueling. I make good money, but I've reached my income ceiling unless I want to take on significantly more responsibility for a modest raise and way less time at home with the kids who really need me right now. Career change doesn't seem wise considering everything.\n\n- I live in a high cost-of-living area of the US. Probably in the top 3. As a result, I live far away from my job to maximize the power of my dollars. Commute is about 45 minutes one way. I won't consider moving closer at this point in my life because a) my life is here now (friends/family), b.) It's important to me that my kids have a stable transition during the divorce. c.) selling my house easily will cost me $40,000 in fees that I'd never recoup.\n\n- After separation, I bought out the ex from our house of 11 years.   House is worth $480,000. After refinancing in my name only, I now carry a mortgage of $368,000 at a  30 year rate of 3.6% (just before rates jumped) and the monthly payment is $2150. I did this in an emotional fog when I probably shouldn't have been making big decisions, but oh well, it is what it is. Initially, I thought, \"Oh no! This is way too much for me to handle alone!\" but have since adjusted and can make it fine on my own income - approx. $135,000. The only issue is it's a 30 year mortgage and I don't care to work an additional 20 years. So, I've been thinking about trying to generate additional income (more on that later).\n\n- I badly need a new car. I drive a 2003 Toyota Corolla with 240000 miles. It's been a great commuter car. I'd keep it except it needs a new catalytic converter $1500 in order to pass emmissions inspection this August. So I COULD put that work into it, but it seems like a foolish move since the car is near end of life. I also HATE car payments and before the divorce had been saving like a madman to try and have cash to purchase a new car. I have about $18,000 toward that goal. The issue there is that since I'm handling bills, mortgage, etc., on my own, I'm all of a sudden extremely reluctant to part with that cash as it serves as a mental cushion. \n\n- I have a self-made, extremely rich uncle (10s of millions-aire) who has offered me an interest free loan for 10 years of $25,000.

Not sure what to do with that if anything...\nHonestly, he probably wouldn't care if I even paid him back, but I would.\n\n- Month to month has been manageable, but at my age, it's like living in my twenties again, watching every penny, and quite frankly, one unexpected event could cause problems.\n\n-Additionally, although I have about 5 years of my girls' college basically paid for (527), I had wanted to pay for all of it. The ex will definitely not contribute.\n\n-So, recently, I've been entertaining the idea of adding a kitchenette to my finished basement (approx. 1400 sq. ft.) at a cost of $10,000 (the average of 3 estimates) and renting it out. There is a separate entrance. Others in the neighborhood do it, it's legal. Checked with my lawyer.\n\n- If I do that, it's approximately a year before I could recapture my initial outlay depending on what I charge for rent. I'm less clear about the unknowns of renting. Many people say it's great, but these are always peppered by a few horror stories. \n\n- If I do the basement, buying a car suddenly becomes a monthly obligation that I just didn't want since I'd be using that money for the basement instead. I hate debt! I COULD use my uncle's money, but my pride says not to unless it's a real emergency.\n\nSO I guess the options on the table are:\n\n1.) buy a badly needed new car by August with the cash I have saved, avoiding a monthly payment.\n\n2.) Fixing the very old, very high mileage car I have for $1500 and hope I can get a few more years out of it (my gut says that's unlikely).\n\n3.) Use part of the $18,000 I have saved for a new car to make my basement habitable for renters, then hope that works out, and also hope my car hangs in there for a while longer.\n\n4.) Don't do anything, sit on the cash I have as a buffer, and use it as needed until I'm a few years away from this divorce.\n\nOther essential details:\n- I pay no child support or alimony \n- Moving is not an option even within my children's current school district. I've crunched the numbers and moving to a house $150,000 less only saves me $350 per month PLUS I lose $40,000+ in the transaction. I'd also like to keep my current sized house because I'd like to meet someone in the future and not have to re \"upsize\" when/if that happens potentially losing even more in real estate fees.\n\n-I have no debt other than the house (no installment payments, no credit card debt, etc.)\n\nWhat do you see that maybe I don't?

After doing a bit more reading, I chose a different fund for my husbands' Roth IRA  (VFIAX) Vanguard 500 Index Fund Admiral Shares (Currently about $20,000).  \n\n3.

I would like to chose something with higher risk for this plan.  They offer four tiers of plans through Fidelity and TIAA: Pre-mixed target date mutual funds, Index funds, Actively managed, Self directed brokerage account.

At this point ideally you would have 1-1.5X your annual income in savings. Obviously there are a variety of reasons that you may be behind and I don't presume to know your financial history but it is something to keep in mind. 1. I would move it over into a cheaper index fund at Schwab/Vanguard/Fidelity.

Nothing wrong with that, but you don't seem to really know what it is, better to sell and get something you are familiar with that's cheaper anyway.\n\n2. A 403b is an employer sponsored plan.

For simplicity, many folks prefer to keep accounts through the same banking entity (i.e. brokerage and IRA and HSA are all at Vanguard).  But you can't combine the actual accounts.

I am totally on board with the idea, but am unsure how much to charge him in rent, and what sort of contract we should draw up for me to protect myself should things go south. I'm thinking charging him half of what he pays now ($650/mo) and splitting utilities, but keeping the tax/insurance/maintenance/repair costs as my expense until we are actually taking concrete steps towards marriage.\n\n\nWhat do you guys think?

Find an Attorney in your area who will offer a free consultation.  \n\nI think your price is fair too; maybe bump it to $700 + utilities, he is still saving $500/mo. \n\n You should be giving a discount on market rent since you don't want to be profiting off boyfriend. Market rent can be the starting point but some sort of discount should be built in. How much discount is a judgement call.   I would not give him such a deep discount on the market rental price.  He's making plenty of money to afford market rent, and you can use his rent plus yours to aggressively pay down the house or save for a wedding.  If things work out and you get married, then there is no \"loss\" of money from you as a couple.  If things don't work out, then you will have gotten a bunch of money to pay down on the house.  I personally would change him 80% of market rate ($1040/month) plus half of your utilities.\n\nThere are a couple of key things to keep in mind as you sign a rental agreement with him:\n\n* Renters are very hard to kick out before their rental agreement is up.  I would recommend finding a rental agreement that phrases itself as a month to month agreement that renews when you cash the rent check at the beginning of the month.\n\n* Make sure he has renters insurance to cover damage to his property if your house were to burn down.  Your insurance won't cover his stuff.\n\n* Make sure you talk to your insurance company so that they know you have a renter/roommate.  It will probably make your insurance higher, but they wont be able to use it as an excuse to deny you coverage.\n\n* Make it explicit (like you suggested) that you are the landlord and are responsible for all repairs and maintenance.\n\n* Use a company like [LegalZoom](https://www.legalzoom.com/personal/real-estate/residential-lease-overview.html) to draft the rental agreement so you don't forget anything important that's required by law.

With all due respect, you're telling OP to turn this into a profit making venture as if her SO was some bum off the street looking for a free ride.

The interest rate on those is likely higher than any mortgage you'd get. \n\nRule of thumb for many is to multiply your income by 3 and set that as the max amount for a mortgage. I usually consider that rule after tax as I'm a little more conservative. In your situation, I would deduct what you finally decide to pay on your student loans from the income number you use when considering how much you can feasibly borrow for a home. What is your monthly net income? Rule of thumb is to keep housing expenses around or under 1/3 of net income. You can probably afford something in the $300-$500K range that will give you a very nice house that fits well within your budget, but you should run the numbers with all your expenses in mind (take into account property taxes, upkeep expenses, etc when calculating total home costs).  At your income level, I'd look toe stay under 38% back-end debt-to-income ratio. That means all your monthly debt payments (credit cards, student loans, car loans, and the house PITI) should be less than 38% of your income. So your total debt load should be about max $5320. Your current debt obligations are 2850, leaving you $2470 for PITI on a house. In most places, that's a lot of house.

Poker can't be a priority vs paying the bills.  People that go to Vegas should only go with what they can afford to lose and recognize that it's a entertainment expense.   At the heart of it, what you are proposing can work IF and only if, your husband does not have access to the main household account.

Have half of those amounts be direct deposited from both paychecks into the first of your accounts.  His remaining pay goes into his account, your remaining pay goes into your second account.

We love our house and have had no major problems with it, but have put some money into it recently (new roof). The rest of the house is in good repair with new everything (completely renovated 2013) and is everything we want in a house. \n\nMy husband is getting relocated temporarily to a different city (2 hours away) for his company this year and the duration will probably be for 1-3 years with us likely moving back to the same area. \n\nI would like to rent our current house out, and then get an apartment for the years we are away.  Husband would like to sell our house all together and buy something in new town and then sell and rebuy something when we move back.   \n\nIn order to rent our house out, we would have to rent it for $1300 a month, which is pretty doable for this area.  That would cover our mortgage and all property taxes and insurance.   Does it make sense to use it as a rental property and then move back into it? \n\nShould we also buy out there and own two properties? We only have about 30k in savings, not enough for a 20% downpayment on a house in that area and keep an emergency fund.  New area is also a more popular city and properties are considerably more expensive. \n\nThe third option is for husband to just do the commute for the couple years (1hr and 45min each way, 30k miles a year) and suck it up, but neither of us are excited about this option.

If so, then you really need to be able to rent for about $1625 to break even. I got to that number by factoring in 10% vacancy and 10% of rent going towards maintenance costs. I didn't include capex (new roof, appliances, etc...) since you said you just replaced it and renovated it recently. You probably won't have many expenditures there within a few years.\n\nSo if your mortgage is $1300, then your yearly expenses with maintenance is $17,160. At $1300 rent, your annual income with 10% vacancy is $14,040. Even without vacancy, it's only $15,600. So you're looking at losing between $1560 to $3120 a year.\n\nAt first blush, it doesn't look good for renting. But of course, there is significant expense involved in buying and selling homes. So if you're *sure* you're coming back to this town in a few years *and* you really love this home, it might be worth just eating that negative cashflow for a few years until you come back home. Otherwise, sell this pig because it's definitely going to be a drain on your finances.\n\nA few variances: I wouldn't buy a home in a city I only plan to live in for 3 years, I'd rent. Second, if you can refinance this home, you could lower your payment significantly and it would be a much better candidate for renting out without losing money every month. But I would probably only consider that if I planned to keep it as a rental and not move back into it. But if you want to own two properties, definitely refinance. having a rental requires time and money.

Don't burn bridges but at the end of the day it's what is best for you. \n\nGive them as much notice as possible and be honest. If the shoe was on the other foot meaning that the company needed to lay you off I don't think that they'd be having this same conversation.  You'd be out the door.   It's all business and as long as you are proper and professional about the departure it's OK to leave  Just do it quickly so they can call back their other potential candidates instead of restarting the interviewing process. If you've only been there for 6 weeks, nobody is going to be particularly concerned if you leave. Just tell them straight up. You're not even going to be putting this job on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 anyway. Be like a politician, say little, say the same thing over and over *\"They made me an offer I could not refuse.\"*; *\"I love it here, but it's business not personal.\"* I left a job after only 10 months in a company that had a very \"you're with us or you're against us\" mindset. The thing that seemed to ease the announcement was telling them that the job called me in to apply and that I wasn't actively looking for other jobs. The fact that you were recruited helps. Stay for a full two weeks after your notice. It might also be good the company you're leaving on your resume in the future.\n\nYou're pretty new so your current job may not counteroffer, but be prepared for one anyways.  Be candid. Express that you know it's unfortunate timing. Make sure they know that the new job found you and made you an offer rather than you were looking for another job. Only allow the current job to make a counter offer if you are prepared to stay. Above all, be candid, express regret and let them know asap. The worst thing you can to is not be proactive and/or be cocky about leaving.  \n\nAnother thing to bear in mind is end and start dates are usuallly negotiable, so if there is a more convenient end date that works for your new employer, offer to stay until then (I'm talking days or weeks, not a whole month or more.) Just make sure you know when your new gig needs you to start before you offer. \n\nAnd, in the end, if your boss decides to take it badly, there's nothing you can do to change someone's reaction. All you can to is be honest and candid. \n\nA possible script could look like:\n\n'Hi boss, do you have a second to chat. Great. I know this is unfortunate timing. I really like this job, but I've unexpectedly been made another offer which is an opportunity to ... (fill in the blank with non-monetary aspect of new job) and comes with more money. I wish I could stay, but at this point in my career I feel the need to take this opportunity. Again, I'm very sorry for the unfortunate timing and if there is anything I can do to ease the transition please let me know. \" I've done this. Just don't say anything critical about the company or try to give them any \"suggestions\" during the exit interview. You won't actually need them for a reference assuming the new job works out well, but always assume that you may work with people again! You want to stick as close to the truth as possible\u2026 Having said that, I would allow myself to be a little embarrassed (because it is an awkward situation) but perhaps the story could be along the lines of \"this is something of a dream opportunity for me and I simply couldn't turn it down\".\n\nI guess what I'm trying to say without saying it is that \"the other job pays five grand more\" may not be a piece of information you need to put out there in the universe.  Under no circumstances would I tell my current management that I'd be willing to stay if they match the salary; you will be putting yourself in a terrible position in the unlikely event your current employer comes through.\n\nAnd most importantly? Congratulations on the new job! All companies/industries our different, but from my experience it's going to be hard not to burn that bridge. Reason being is that they most likely invested a lot of time/money into recruiting and training. At least give your current employer the opportunity to match the offer and position.  If the company had to make the same decision they wouldnt think twice about laying you off. The only company you should be loyal to is one you own. Give them 2 weeks if you can.\n\nRemember, they would give you 20 minutes to pack your stuff if the shoe were on the other foot.  ... Hey I like this job but I got offered a new job that pays me more can you up my wages an extra five grand ? . If he can't take the other job. Money is everything but it pays the bills. Tell them that exactly. Well, maybe not the pay raise exactly but let them know you have a new opportunity you want to explore. A months notice is more than enough and your employer will really appreciate giving them that early of a notice. Be straight with them.  Tell them why you are going.  I'm sure they will appreciate it more than letting them down gently  When I started my job, the girl who had been hired about a month before me quit 3 weeks after I started. She'd been an English major and loved running / mountain biking / hiking. She had applied for a dream job before getting the one at our company and heard back from them a week before she left us. She told our bosses that it was absolutely nothing personal but that this job would allow her to do the things she loved while utilizing her degree in the way she'd wanted, and she was taking it. It's never personal, it's business.  I did this.  I got laid off my job a few years back and tried to get hired in to my current job, but it's a large international company and there's a lot of red tape to get through... needless to say it doesn't happen overnight.\n\nSo in the meantime I put in applications all over and got hired at a small company.  Well about a month later I'm getting calls from the recruiter for the company I work for now (the big one).  I do the interviews, ok the background checks, etc. etc.  All the while I haven't told my employer I'm probably going to leave.  I intended to give a 2 weeks notice once I knew for sure I was hired.\n\nHowever during the process of the background check the investigators called my employer.  My boss asks me about it and I explain the situation honestly.  He seemed ok with it.  Once I got a hire date, I gave them a 2 weeks notice and we left on good terms. Check to see if the company has any advance notice guidelines (often two weeks) or requirements and try to meet those, but be prepared that they might show you the door the minute you tell them. You flipped a job over $5k? Hardly worth it. Tell your boss asap, they might match it. It takes a lot to employ someone, lots of people are involved - payroll, security, uniform, admin etc. Don't be surprised if they are pissed off. Oh, the bridge is burned.  Forget about that.  Just leave this old job off your resume and extend your new job an extra month or two in the past to cover the gap.  As far as you're concerned, this job you're in now never happened.

If you have custody, he's not 'letting' you claim her. Please please please go for a consult with at least two divorce lawyers.

It doesn't mean you have to have a fighty divorce. It means you won't leave things open that could come back to bite you, or leave your daughter in a more vulnerable position than she has to be. After speaking with a lawyer, if you feel like the arrangement you came to is fair, get it written down and vetted and formalized.

Could this affect my credit score? Is this classed as debt? Any help would be appreciated. \n\nThanks!  \n\nEdit: I've looked at your responses. Most were helpful. Some were not. Thank you to everyone though. And to make things clear, I am going to pay the money back. ", "title": "My old job over payed me, I've just received a final reminder to pay the money back.

UK", "comments": "If you agree that the money was wrongly paid to you, and the amount in the letter matches your records, you should pay it back immediately. Why don't you start by giving them a call and telling them you never recieved any other letter(s). Also the money doesn't seem to be rightfully yours, so it would be fair to give them their money back...\n\nObviously sucks to have to give money back though  first things first. get a statement asking how you were overpaid. if it matches penny-to-penny then all is well. otherwise you'll need to dispute. second if you're in the US and it's been six months, once you pay them you'll need an adjusted w2. Also no shame in asking for a settled in full letter, so it doesn't come back later to bite you in case they get sheisty with you. If you're in the UK [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/?utm_source=amp&utm_medium=post_header) may also be a helpful place to ask.  why don't you pay it back It's my understanding of such things here in the UK that you had to reasonably believe you had been paid correctly and did not cause the overpayment through your own error, without knowing the amount it is hard to say if you could reasonably not noticed.  \n\n Also, there is the fact you did notice and held onto the money, so you honestly can't claim to have spent it in good faith.  \n\nI'd pay it back if I could, or make an offer to pay back at an affordable rate, if they refuse such an offer (they won't), let them take you to court and the judge would likely throw it out as they hate refusals of reasonable offers in county courts.  \n\n  \nedit to add: I'd make all contact though email followed up with a recorded letter if you think it is possible to end up in court. (only costs about \u00a31 extra to send recorded) You know full well they overpaid you.\n\nThat money is not yours.\n\nPay it back. Maybe they tried to contact you at work even though you didn't work there anymore?\n\nEither way, you know they overpaid you and they figured it out. Do the right thing and give the money back.\n\nIt won't affect your credit if you give them their money back. This happened to me in the UK too. Went 1 step away from court proceedings then I offered to pay half of what I owed. They accepted and we settled out of court with no adverse affect to my credit rating. Would've been different if it had gone to court though I reckon. In the US you would have to pay the money back.  Not sure how things are in the UK, but I would assume it would be the same.  Make sure they get your taxes right - in the US when this happens, companies sometimes forget to fix your W-2 causing you to get hit by the taxes for the overpayment even though you paid it back. Isn't keeping it the same as stealing?  I think you knew the answer when you writing this up :)\n\nCut them a check and be done with it.\n\n Paid. Sorry. A very common spelling in Reddit.  Hi i'm in the U.K too. I had a friend in a similar situation, he waited like you until he received a letter about a year down the line, he just played dumb and agreed to pay \u00a310 a month, might be an option rather than paying in one lump. I would be more concerned about a negative reference, than a credit rating in a country I'm not living in anymore. Pay it back.

We all have collectively failed at teaching him proper financial responsibility.  So he has utterly no grasp of financial burden.\n\nHow do I go about showing him the real whole picture of going to a state University on loans?  The military is the only resource I know of that pays the way only because I'm a vet.  I would appreciate some other available paths to a college education, but mostly want to be able to show him his average pay in the field he is choosing then how long it will take to pay off his loans.\n\nAlso if there are other things I should be bringing up in this discussion please feel free to help out an unprepared step dad talk to his woefully unprepared stepson.", "title": "Kid is about to go to college and I'm terribly stupid with money, how do I explain the costs of student loans.", "comments": "There are lots of need-based grants available from many universities as well. I don't know how much more you can do though other than informing your step son that it's a possibility. *However,* there are two additional things to consider:\n\n1. Someone who doesn't want to serve in the military probably shouldn't in order to get school paid for (heard that from a relative who went through ROTC).\n\n2. Your a stepfather, so ultimately you should probably stay out of executive decision making or executive decision participation on this matter. You may feel like you played a large role in raising your stepson, but you didn't play primary role, especially if the father is a big enough part of the sons life to say \"never joining military\". A tool to use might be http://unbury.us . Fill in the amount of debts you expect him to have after his studies, plus the expected interest rate (let's say 7%), and fill in a minimum payment of 1% of the total debt per month. The website will plot how long it will take to pay off that debt. If he wants to pay more per month, change the monthly payment. ([Here](http://unbury.us/#monthly_payment=500&name_0=Student%20loan&balance_0=50000&payment_0=500&rate_0=7&) I put in a total loan amount of $50k, $500 minimum payment at 7% interest rate - takes almost 13 years to pay it off).\n\nTry to also give him an idea about what kind of budget he'll have. So give him estimates for things like rent, utilities, groceries etc. So that he doesn't think he can pay $1500/month when his net income will be $1800/month (for example). \n\nFinally I want to say: I'm not totally against him taking out loans. There is a potential reward: if the loans and the study get him into a higher-paying career field, then it's possible that say after seven years of tough payments he will be debtfree *and* have a higher income than if he hadn't done his study. But there of course is also a risk - and he shouldn't take on too high a burden. But taking on *some* loans might be beneficial.  There are 2 discussions you need to have with your step-son. One is around financial management, and one is around program/school selection. Treat them as separate things even though they are of course related.\n\nFor the financial management discussion, start off by reading the PF sidebar together and discussing everything he has questions about. If you can't answer them, google them or post them here =)\n\nFor the program/school selection discussion, start by asking him what he wants to do with his life. If he's got one father telling him to not even consider the military and one telling him to not take out student loans, that's not going to make him feel supported during an incredibly pivotal/stressful time. Student loans taken out for the right program, at the right time, in the right location, at the right school, for the right reasons, can be fine. Your best way to help your step-son is to start talking about those things. What does he want to do with his life? What kind of work does he find fulfilling? Where does he want to live? What kind of lifestyle does he want? Once he has an idea of those, he can start narrowing down the programs (and schools) that would allow him to achieve those things. Once the program/school options are narrowed down, you can consider each of them and their financial ramifications in turn (using knowledge from the previous discussion to make informed choices). It may be that he'll need a very expensive program for a specialized degree that will give him the work and life he wants - or he may be able to get that with a general program from the local community college degree at a fraction of the price. Either way - encourage a program that comes with an internship or co-op or something...! =P  \n>How do I go about showing him the real whole picture of going to a state University on loans?  \n\nAren't in state tuitions relatively inexpensive in the grand scheme of things?\n\n(Compared to being out of state at least) You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Student Loans wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)\n- [\"How to handle $\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)\n- [What's the best way to pay down my debt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_what.27s_the_best_way_to_pay_down_my_debt.3F)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

The trick is going in with a plan and realistic expectations about how to manage and pay off that debt.\n\nGetting just the grants and subsidized student loans necessary to go to a state school is not usually how people end up in unconquerable student debt.\n\nCommunity college and using the military are options worth discussing, but equally important is hammering out what kind of major he wants and what kind of timeframe that income potential will give him to pay off the loans he needs.  Military is not the only way to get your schooling paid for. Teach For America will pay off all of your student loans, as well as many urban Inner City schools that are hard-up for teachers. You just have to teach for five years after graduating college.\n\nNot sure if there are other ways to get college paid?  Going to vocational school or spending a few years at community college first is something to think about, too. Parents are misguided if thry believe that students can just borrow enough money to pay for the entirety of a university degree.  As a general rule, most students can borrow in their own name/credit is the government loans ($5500 for the first year, with gradual increases each year).  To borrow more than that, your stepson would need to have a parent take out Parent Plus loans or cosign on private loans.

Plus you both already have fairly high debt as it is and relatively low amount of savings for your earnings. \n\nYou're not ready for a house. I'd aggressively pay off the car and credit card debt at least and save 50K more for the down payment and closing costs and bump up your savings for the 6 month emergency fund. \n\nAlso, girlfriend. I'd very carefully look at the legal and financial ramifications to putting both your names on the title and mortgages.    You are not ready to buy a home, especially in the Bay Area. You are making 150,000 combined and are carrying $22,000 in CC debt and have very little in savings. There is no logical explanation for this other than the two of you are living recklessly and don't know how to manage your money.\n\nIt's a kind gesture by her father but the two of you will end up throwing that money down the drain on a house you either can't afford or even if you can based on your current spending habits will end up losing.\n\nEstablish an emergency fund and pay off your debt as quickly as you can. This is more important than anything else at this point. Once you've done this, then start exploring purchasing your own place. I would also HIGHLY recommend waiting until you are married before doing this. Looks like we have a lot of looking in the mirror before even starting to think about such a huge life decision! Thank you everyone who posted and gave us a good starting point. The help is definitely appreciated. You... are 172k in debt. Do not buy a house! What on earth are you thinking is this even a real question?\n\nRe-evaluate your lifestyle. If you are making 150k a year and still racking up credit card debt then something is VERY VERY WRONG. Man posts like this always make my situation feel better. I'm assuming individually you both make what I do, and I went out and bought a 12k car and I feel I should have cut that amount in half. You both are in a stupid amount of debt, you need to ask your girlfriends father if you can take that 50k to pay down that CC debt. $1850 for a one bedroom in the Bay Area is not bad. Why do you want to give that up when you're in so much debt? Cut down on your lifestyle expenses (eating out, bars, etc.) and pay off that debt. With your income, you could be out of debt completely in 4-5 years, which will make a *MUCH* bigger impact on your financial future.\n\nThis also might be a cultural thing, but I would never cosign on a loan with somebody who is not my spouse or a direct family member. I know a few people who have done this and it boggles my mind. If you don't trust someone enough to marry them, why do you trust them to share half a million dollars in debt? A marriage is easily annulled, but $500k never goes away.\n\nAlso.. $50 x 5 = $250,000. You can only afford a $250,000 home without paying PMI (private mortgage insurance), which is going to have a major effect on the long-term cost of your mortgage. Your girlfriend's father is a delusional baby boomer who still thinks it's 1965. If you are going to live in the Bay Area long term, I think you should completely banish all thoughts of home ownership from your mind. Mere mortals do not buy homes in SF anymore. You have too much other debt to make this a good idea - especially in one of the most expensive housing markets in the country. You both make plenty of money that you should not be carrying any credit card or car debt. You have nothing saved for a contribution to a downpayment and nothing saved to help with closing costs or the cost of home ownership after the fact. 50k isn't going to go very far as a down payment.\n\nIf you want to own I would pay off the credit cards, pay off or sell the cars and only own cars outright. Figure out how much home you are comfortable purchasing, and make a goal of saving 20% down including the $50k if that offer still stands. Also plan on saving 3-6 months of total expenses (expenses that will occur after you own a place). That will take some financial discipline to get there but you'll be in a much stronger position by doing it. First pay off that 22k in credit card debt, then pay off the 100k in student loans. The cars are WAY to expensive with the amount of debt you two have. Should have never bought them but you have them so I guess nothing you can do now. Anyways what are you 2 doing with all your money? Why are you in so much debt with such high incomes? I'd really start budgeting ASAP. You need to stop spending so much. I assume you bring home 9-10k a month. Even with rent of almost 1.8k where is the other 7-8k going every month? Even if you spend let's say 1k on food and fun, 3k on car,credit cards and student loans(which is probably a high estimate), and 1k on utilites,gas,car insurance, internet and phones, you should still have 1k-2k leftover to throw to loans or save! I'd see if he let you have that 50k to pay off your debt. Then you can start saving for a home. That be your best bet. Take the 50k, pay off her car and CC then your CC. Keep making those payments but to your self. After a year, see where you are at and then start thinking about it.  You guys need to focus on getting rid of that debt before anything else.  Also, buying in Santa Clara county is insane. It's hard enough with a dual-income household, but you have to make serious money to live comfortably.  If you do want to try a condo, I'd try Contra Costa, like someone else had suggested, or even Solano though the options aren't that great. I had considered getting a condo myself, but the HOA dues are pretty up there.\n\nI'd suggest getting married first too. I'm a bit of a pessimist though... Your lifestyles up to this point must be ridiculous.  People would kill to make the sort of money you guys do but you've clearly been pissing it all away instead of paying off debts and being responsible. If you've been in a well-paying job for 9 years you should definitely be in a position to get a house by now. But whatever you've been doing up to now has fucked that right up. Start re-assessing your priorities before you chuck even more money away. get rid of debt first..  Until married, don't assume joint liability for a mortgage loan...just -don't-.   Do not pass go do not collect 50k.   If you marry you both have legal recourse if things go pear shaped, and incentive to pay the mortgage. Get out of San Jose, it always comes up in the top 3 most expensive cities for housing in the nation. Try somewhere at least an hour out from the city and commute.\n\nFirst off, before accepting the 50k, read Dave Ramsey's \"Total Money Make Over\" and also \"Rich Dad Poor Dad\" to get some long term financial prospective.\n\nPay down a good amount of debt, build up a decent savings, consider getting rid of the expensive car, practice your budgeting skills and get married first. \n\nIt does take courage to be honest about your financial situation and post your debts online for people to give their opinions. I admire that, not many people can honestly do that.\n\nThe fact that you are willing to be honest about your finances and willing to listen to advice means that you have it in you to make this home buying goal come true... not this year but sometime soon. Try to set a goal for 2018. \n\n Never buy a house with someone else unless you are legally married. Search this subreddit for stories abou BF GF getting a house then it goes south. Plus you have tons of debt. This can't be real.  There is no way it's real.  So many things wrong with everything that's been said. 150k is zero dollars in the bay area, so there is that. Take the cash and pay off your cars.  then try and figure out why you can't take a six-figure income and manage to save up more than 5k at a time.  Your budget is zero dollars until you can manage to drastically restrict your outrageous lifestyle inflation.  I hate to say it, but I think you'd be better off having your girlfriend kill off a good part of her debt.  I'd say kill the car note and credit card, and put the other $20,000 into saving in an ohshit fund.  That'll leave her with her student loans, and you with your debt.  \n\nThen concentrate on killing off your credit card debt.  The car note you have is that your mother's car or your car?  If it's her car, see if you can get out from under it by getting her to refinance the car without having you as a co-signer.  If it's your car, then once you kill the credit cards off, kill the car off.\n\nBasically, at this point you've got a chance to get out from under a lot of debt before you buy the house, which is something you really want to do.  20% down on a $400,000 is $80,000, which means you'll be paying $1,540.67 a month.  So you will be saving a little over $300 a month.  I think you'll do better killing the debt in the long run. This, children, is a perfect example of why credit score is not a very accurate indicator of overall financial health. Talk to gf's dad and see if he would be willing to drop that 50k directly into his daughter's highest interest loan instead, that would be a much better use of his money. Both of you need better credit habits, by my calculations you could completely wipe both of your cards in about 2 paychecks and still have enough left over for your other debt obligations. This will save you *bookus* in interest. 1850 rent is *great* for the bay area so just stay there until you get your life in order.  1st thing - you should really get married before taking money from her dad to buy a house :)\n\nPurely finically - go back to her dad and say we $172k in debt now and can we use that to pay down our/her debt. Also, think about how buying will raise your monthly spending on a house from $1800 to at least $2200, which gives \n\nThen lay out your budget and plans for the next 5 years and show him how that 50k will get you closer to your goals with his daughter :)\n Use the money to pay off her student loan....\nYou guys are out of control and either of you losing your job will have MAJOR consequences.  For perspective, our income is 1/2 yours. We bought a house for 130k (at the time debt free with 10k savings) in the Puget Sound area a year ago and have racked up 7k in cc debt since then (mostly home ownership related, the spending doesn't stop at signing) and bought a 21k car for my wife. My truck is 12 yrs old and paid for. I lose sleep over the 7k cc debt. It might be worth looking into different areas in the bay such as Contra Costa County. The San Jose area is one of the most expensive markets in the bay. You get more bang for your buck the further inland you go, such as Tracy, Brentwood, Discovery Bay... Even Hayward or San Leandro might be more viable options as long as you don't mind a commute. I would contact a good mortgage broker. They can look at all the information and tell you what you would qualify for and what the next steps might be. I live in the bay and have used Golden Bay Mortgage Group several times. Rene was helpful with any questions and he wasn't pushy in trying to get me to purchase more house than I felt comfortable paying for. Get your finances in order. I strongly suggest reading anything by Dave Ramsey and listening to his podcast. You could even call in and ask him what he thinks you should do. He's probably say get married and attack your debt first. The fact you're getting the downpayment well ahead of when you're ready to spend it could be a silver lining. \n\nTaking a year or so to pay off your credit card debt and get married could give you some space to make the smart, uncommon move of planning out your househunting before you start. It's easy to lose money in real estate in a very challenging (over-priced) area, well beyond the size of the downpayment gift. Even if the money was deposited today and you closed tomorrow, if you have to move out a few years later because you just end up hating the house, or you didn't put in enough research, the closing costs and finders fee and taxes for that first year could negate a lot of the downpayment gift's value anyway. Taking a year to prepare (ie, pay off the credit card debt) makes sure the $50,000 isn't wasted. \n\nBudget tight and when 2018 rolls around tomorrow there'll be a lot to look forward to. I suggest you guys do a [no spend month](http://www.bankrate.com/finance/smart-spending/savings-challenge-try-a-no-spend-month-1.aspx). My wife and I did it, and it gave us a lot of perspective about the things we really care about enough to spend money and what was just waste. Living below our means has meant less stress, more unity, and more security.\n\nAnother helpful financial technique I came up with (probably not the first) is to give yourselves each a \"fun money\" allowance that you can spend on whatever you want. This way, you don't judge each other's spending and it helps to develop a sense of restraint where you can't just buy everything you want. > Who should be the first person we talk to regarding this.\n\nEach other, about setting a budget and sticking to it, so you can pay off all your high interest debt and start saving to buy a house or condo responsibly. Take the money and put it in a CD for a couple of years. Take that time to repay some of your debt and save up more money. \n\nUse loan calculator to check much loan you can get after factoring in your current debt payments.\n\n\n Talk to her dad about holding onto the cash until you are ready. In the meantime, you can build that 50k into a larger deposit and pay off some of your debt. A lot of people that rush into buying a place too quickly will have some regrets. I too live in the South Bay and all I can say is what has already been said - get your debt under control before you can even dream of this Go talk to a mortgage broker. They will set you on the path to seeing what you need to do with your debt and show how it works. My biggest objection to your situation is buying something large with someone else.  I would say buying a home while having 20k+ CC debt is irresponsible, but don't let student loans scare you away from home ownership.\n\nFirst thing to figure out (after you pay your CC debt off on your own) is whether renting or owning is more expensive. Can't speak for the Bay area, but here is Phoenix, owning is surprisingly cheaper (on paper) than renting in many cases, even factoring in taxes and PMI (but not accounting for house repairs, as we're talking about a condo here where repairs aren't as bad). That student loan debt, as long as you are paying your payments every month, is actually good for your credit too.\n\nOne thing that is worth mentioning. I highly recommend not even considering buying a house together before you are married, and you will want to work out some kind of equity agreement should you get divorced in the future (no one like to talk about it, but it's smart to plan ahead).\n\nFor now, tell your GF's dad that you are incredibly grateful for his offer, but you want to get yourself in a better financial position before pulling the trigger on a home. Tell him that should you get married, once you are in a good financial position, you will happily take his offer. Also, minor note, but if it isn't a big deal to you, don't splurge on an expensive wedding. It will only set you back further. Do you ever think to youself \"Damn, we are pulling in $150k but still have 22k in credit card debt\"? If I were you I wouldnt be able to sleep knowing that I am pissing all that money away.  If I was in your situation, I would cut all living expenses down to 50000 per year total for you both. I would then put all the rest of the money to paying off the debts and building an emergency fund.  In about two years you would both be debt free earning that much money.  [removed] Nice catch!!! Only thing i ever got from my girlfriends dad was a warning to never bring her back.  >Plan on proposing this year. \n\nDo that tomorrow. Why are you *planning* to plan to get married?!?\n\nCA is a community property state. So that $50k will be half yours if you're married. ;)\n\nAs everyone else has said, you need to pay off your debts and save aggressively for retirement before you start thinking about buying a house.

If you have electric baseboard heat, or any electric major appliances like a water heater, dryer, range, or oven, then the effects of leaving a light on will be negligible. Since you're renting you have little control over the infrastructure of your home. The best thing you can do is find ways to limit major usage. Turn down the thermostat, get a flow-restricting shower head, use fans when A/C isn't necessary, etc. Yes, but the cost of lighting your house is not huge to begin with.\n\nA/C and appliances are the big power suckers. This is more of a question for /r/thrifty\n\nBut as stated, the upfront cost of LED bulbs vs. potential savings are negligible.\n\nInstead here are a few potential money savers: \n\n* Turn your water heater to \"warm\" and take quick showers. It works less to heat up the water all day.\n* Find the fridge's recommended temp and turn  it up (warmer) a notch.\n* If you have little or nothing in the freezer, put a couple of gallon jugs of water. It'll keep the freezer from cycling on and off.\n* Make sure the dish washer setting is on light when you wash. \n* Buy a toaster oven and microwave (used) so you don't have to heat up a big oven.\n* If your windows gets direct sunlight, use a car's sunshade (they're cheap) to prevent the place from getting too hot.\n* If it gets too cold, use a space heater, not central heat.\n* Washing machines and dryers, make sure they're both full, but not overfilled. Clean the lint trap!\n* Halogen bulbs use lots of electricity, find an alternative light source.\n* Single ply toilet papers suck---don't cut this corner. Buy Two ply.\n Not much.  Replacing windows, new efficient furnace.. always turning your lights/electronics off when you aren't using them.  If the house is inefficient as a renter there isn't much you can do. Hey, some good advice here, however, I wouldnt turn the water heater down unless you know what temp to set it at. Dont take it below 60 degree C as you will allow bacteria to build up in your hotwater tank. (If its a combi boiler this dosnt really matter.)\nDepending on how you rent, maybe shop for better utility suppliers. \nAlso, depending on the type and age of tv, it could cost you around 200-300 to run for a year. (Everyday 6hr use. ) so be wary. \nIf you can get your land lord or utility supplier to install a smart meter. Then you can see exactly what your using. \nMy advice would be buy draft excluders, and cut you heating/AC times in half.(if you can do this with out being uncomfartble, go put a jumper on,or walk around naked,thats halfed you heating/ac cost right there.)\nDont use the dishwasher if there is one, and if you do make sure its full ever time you use it. Simple things like this and what others have said will only save a little here and there, BUT , all togther it will add up to somthing. **Electricity:**\n\n* LED bulbs do use less electricity. check with your utility company, you might be eligible for rebates\n* regulate the temp in the fridge/freezer, not too high, not too low\n\n**Heating:**  best thing you can do is to install a thermostat with weekdays/weekend timer.  I like the *Sensi Wi-Fi Programmable Thermostat, 1F86U-42WF for Smart Home* which is internet enabled, and about $100 at Amazon.  Check with your local utility, you might be eligible for a rebate, I was, and they gave me $100, so it was free.  Set it up according to your schedule so it's warm enough when you're home, and maintenance warm when you're not home. As a first time home renter, one of the most important things you should actually do is to make sure you do all the things to protect yourself for when you move out. Look around for nightmare landlord posts on Reddit and you'll get an idea. The big things I can think of are to read your lease very carefully, and make sure to take photos of the apartment before you move in.

If the money came out of a joint account with your sister and your name on it, you're out of luck. You can't prove the debt isnt yours anymore.This concept can apply to businesses and company cars except you need 12 months of payments.   And not puttin her sister on the loan screwed her as well.  That would had help her increase her credit score. Why did someone with such terrible credit need a $40,000 car?  \n\nI think your SIL should either refinance the car in her own name or sell it to pay out the finance.  She can then go buy whatever car she can afford on her own.  You and your wife shouldn't have to delay buying a home because of your SIL's financial problems.\n\nEDIT: Okay, many people have pointed out that lots of people with terrible credit can afford a $40k car.  The fact that the SIL hasn't missed a payment is evidence of this.  My point is that when you're using someone else's credit rating you should probably keep your borrowing to a minimum.  A used Toyota Sienna for $10k would probably be nearly as reliable as a new Dodge Journey. How long was the loan for?  If you borrowed $40k for a car 4 years ago then surely there isn't much left? After 4 years of payments, the principle is 40k?  Did she co-sign on a 70k car? Do your your wife know what cosigning for a loan means?\n\n\nWhen you co-sign a loan you become 100% responsible for that debt. There is no such thing as \"only\" a co-signer. Doesn't matter who is paying,it's going to count against your wife no matter what. Your wife currently owes $40,000. Your wife agreed to owe $40,000 when she said \"sure, I'll co-sign for you.\"\n\n\nAs far as what happened as far as financing, that's another issue entirely. Maybe the loan originator just saw that he didn't need to run your SIL's credit because your wife qualified by herself, and drew up the paperwork that way and nobody was paying attention to what they were signing. However, **this does not matter**.\n\n\nEither way your sis in law needs to refinance the car in her own name, or sell it.\n\n\nEdit: you also have no way whatsoever to force or compel your sis in law to refinance, so I hope she is willing to. This could very well prevent you from buying a house unless your sister in law is *extremely* cooperative. So, aside from all the judging going on about proper prices for the car, shady car dealer tactics, implying that your wife supported a bad decision by your sister-in-law, etc. -- you all need to sit down with sister-in-law and explain that the loan is preventing you from  using your dream house.  Sister-in-law needs to either refinance somehow in her or her husband's name, or to sell the car, pay the loan to zero, and buy a cheap car.  Regardless of the initial misunderstanding about co-signing or not, a reasonable sister would not want to be an impediment to her sibling getting a house, would she? You don't seem to be asking a question so I will make a comment.\n\nThere are several threads on here about co-signing.  I do taxes for people and so they think I am also their financial confessor.  I am asked 2 or 3 times a year about co-signing or lending to friends family.  Here is my answer.  Co-sign or loan as much as you wouldn't mind giving that person because in the end you may have.\n\nI go to the bank.  The bank takes one look at my financial history and says, NOPE.  A predatory lender takes a look at my financial history and says, NOPE.  So I come to you with my sob story and ask a favor.  \n\nThe gist of that favor is for you to become responsible for what I am not considered responsible enough to handle.  That is it in a nutshell.  The bank doesn't consider me responsible enough to lend money to.  But being a bank, and craving that interest, if I can sucker someone into being responsible for that they will be happy to lend the money, at a higher rate.  \n\nAnd loaning money, co-signing are essentially the same thing.  Someone without their act together needs your money or your credit line.  So keep in mind when you write that $500 check you will probably never see that money again.  Keep in mind when you co-sign that $5000 loan that you are responsible and the odds are good that you will end up paying at least part of the loan.  Because if the person borrowing the money was responsible, capable of paying the money back, they wouldn't need a co-signer to begin with.\n First, your wife should look at the copies she has of all the paperwork she signed.  If she doesn't have copies, or doesn't recall what she signed then shame on her.  There are only three possibilities here:  1) the dealer fraudulently changed the paperwork in which case you have legal recourse; 2) your wife didn't bother to read or understand what she was signing in which case she pretty much deserves the blame for this mess; or 3) your wife isn't being honest with you about what she agreed to.\n\nSecond, when I've been involved in a car loan with co-signers both the loan and the car title have been joint.  In fact the person with the stronger credit is generally listed first.  Same thing with co-signing an apartment lease - the \"co-signer\" was listed on the lease as a regular joint lessee/tenant even if all understood they didn't live there.  \n\nPeople somehow get the impression that if they are co-signing that they are not primary on the loan so it won't effect their credit as much as if the loan were theirs.  This is not the case (at least not in my state and I presume it is the same elsewhere). \n\nSo I don't think this would have made a difference on your wife's credit even if the sister was equally on the loan which should have happened.\n\nOne confusing point to me:  Is your wife on the car title too?  What names appear on the title and registration?  And if the answer is your wife's name, then very importantly:  In whose name is the insurance and what names (if any) are listed as insured's on the insurance policy?\n\nI think the only out for this is for the sister to attempt to refinance the loan and put everything into her name only. \"Co-signer\" doesnt relinquish any liability on a loan.  I co-signed for my brother once.  Will never \"co-sign\" again.  Every time he missed a payment, guess who got a phone call or letter in the mail? Yes, me.\n\nIMO, there is no such thing as business with family. Its either a gift or a favor.  \n\nLess learned at an early age.\n\nAnd 40k on a car when you have no credit or bad credit is rediculous.  We pull in $170k a year and drive and have cars under $20k.  \n\nUsed to have a $50k car before kids.  But will never do that again.\n\n From an income to debt ratio perspective, it wouldn't have mattered if SIL was coborrower. Your wife would still be 100% responsible for the debt. Your SIL needs to sell/trade the car if you want to buy the house. It really doesn't matter. Your wife is equally and severally responsible for the car no matter what name is first on the contract. \n\nCan the sister and her husband refinance it? run the figures if you were to buy the car from her and then sell it.  I'm pretty sure the dealer pulled a fast one on them just to get the sale. We fell for a similar trick a few years back.  Dealer asked my aunt to find a cosigner, to which I stupidly agreed to.  At the financing table, they told us that if they make me the primary person on the loan, the interest rates will be much better and my aunt will be a secondary person so it will improve her credit.  \n\nThis was all bullshit. The paperwork did not list her at all and when we asked about it they said that she's a part of the loan because her bank account will be the one set up for the monthly payments and in one year the loan will be fully transferred to her.  More BS that we believed.\n\nFortunately, we realized our stupidity the very next day and took action immediately to try to reverse the sale.  It wasn't easy but was eventually done because we had proof they committed fraud and threatened to take legal action.\n\nIn your case, I doubt there's much you can do about it now after 4 years.  At least your sister in law was able to make the payments and did not hurt your wife's credit.  What sucks is now it's affecting your home purchase and your sister in law was probably expecting a bump in her credit after all those payments. If your wife is the sole borrower it's likely the title of the car is in her sole name also - which means that if it is involved in an accident your wife is liable for damages. Is this car on your insurance? Yesh, that sounds like a bad situation. Im not sure anything can help. If the SILs credit is still tanked, she wont be able to get a loan to \"buy\" the car drom your wife. I think you guys might be stuck until the loan gets small enough. I hope SIL doesnt screw up any payments! Sounds like she should have read the paperwork I believe you can use your own credit and leave your wife off it so that debt is not a factor, though I have have no way to know whether you alone would qualify for the loan you need.\n\nOtherwise your sister needs to refinance the loan in her name, preferably at a credit union since they tend to be more reputable. It may be that if you explain the situation to a loan officer they will see that your sister has been consistent with payments (there is evidence that she is the one paying since the money comes out of her account) and will take her business.\n\nIf neither of those work, your only option may be to sell the car, for which you will very likely take a hit of thousands of dollars since you're probably not going to get enough to pay off the loan, but at least the bulk of the debt will be gone.\n\nAs for your sister, she may need a car but she doesn't need that car. It's her responsibility to buy a car she can afford. If she has been paying off a loan of that size consistently there's no reason she shouldn't be able to get something reasonable. Look up the Dave Ramsey method of buying cars. You buy the best car you can afford to pay cash for, keep saving the payments you would have been making, and when that car bites it you take the cash you saved and buy a better one. Do this a couple times and you'll have a pretty nice car, debt free. Of course this assumes she isn't piling on tons of credit card debt in order to afford the car payments, which is probably likely but not your fault or responsibility.\n\nYour wife did something nice but Ill advised. Time to put her own family first now and hopefully your sister understands. Never, ever assume that a car dealer is going to do something nice for you.  That industry's track record of being sleazy is well-earned.  \n\nOh, what's that Grandma, you dropped your nickel did you?  Outta the way, old lady!  That nickel is mine!!! I worked for lenders for 10 years. It shocks me how many people sign things they didn't read, or don't bother to research what their responsibilities are before signing. Case and point: the shocking number of people who finance or lease cars, then stop making payments when the car needs a repair because \"the lender should pay for it.\" In BC, it doesn't matter if she is the principal loan holder or a co-signer. It has the exact same effect on your credit. You could become liable for those expenses, and so from a risk standpoint, they treat it as though you are.\n\nIt doesn't matter if she's principal or not. It's always a good idea to check with TransUnion and Equifax on an annual basis to check what might be showing on your credit history.  Google both companies to find out how.  This can help detect any identity theft or other issues before they become a problem when you apply for credit. I hope your wife has her name on the title.... How and why would your sister In law with poor credit rating need a 40k car..  Former car loan financier in British Columbia chiming in. \nTwo things, firstly this kind of arrangement if you were not told about it is shady. It is even more shady because the financier at the dealership did not tell the bank. They likely fudged the void cheque because it didn't have your name on it. The one given to the bank to have the payments come out, I say this because to release the funds to the dealership from the bank they need all of their documents in a row, the last usually being that void cheque. \n\nConsigning is different than what happened in your case. You are not both principal owners of the vehicle, and the insurance may even be void. \n\nUnder the Lein of the car, the lein would be registered to you only, if the financing were yours only. Check the paperwork that was given to the insurance agent. Check the transfer form (it's the carbon copy piece of paper). Likely she is on title of a vehicle that is financed under someone else's name. This is something you can actually take to the bank where it was financed. \nThe bank won't like if they have a lien on a car registered to you, but the title of the car is in someone else's name. The insurer would not have done the new vehicle transfer without the principal operator being on title as owner of the car. \n\nTechnically it's fraudulent what the dealership did, but there isn't much you can do now other than get her name on the loan agreement since title is in her name. Title being in her name should twist the banks arm to get her name on. Hopefully that should help a little with your mortgage. \n\nEdit: people are asking about terms. Dealerships can put vehicles in shady terms including a 60/84 contract. This kind of contract is a 60 month payment contract so it ends after five years. The only trouble is that it's amortized over 84 months so you owe two years of payments in a \"balloon\" payment at the end of the loan. \nThe amount of times someone came into my office yelling and screaming about their term being up and being send a bill for 8000 dollars... the guy before me in the office made a lot of mistakes I couldn't clean up. \n\nThe other option you have is to go to the vehicle sales authority of Bc. They govern the sale and financing of vehicles and will investigate your claim. If the title and lien are indeed in two different names they have the ability to make things happen. But only if someone clearly did something illegal. \n\n Car dealer here, when we submit a deal to the bank, the bank will automatically put the person with strong credit as the main buyer. That's just how they do it. Here's the good news though. Since it's been 4 years since the car has been purchased, and she hasn't missed any payments, you can have the car refinanced to have your wife removed from the loan! Chances are the interest rate might go down too.  Former car salesman, just get them to make the pitch again with whomever is your local consumer protection agent and then have them read the contract they want you to sign, might cost a good chunk for the guy though...This stuff does happen in the car industry but atleast in the US the fines and penalties can be very very step. My father who owned a car lot is still paying off his fines from being a liar among other shitty things.  Your sister in law's credit was probably so bad that they weren't about to get the loan approved with her on it at all. Once your wife agreed to \"cosign\" she was actually agreeing to be financially responsible for the loan. They would have signed the paperwork explaining all of this, so at this point the dealership legally hasn't done anything wrong. However if the dealership falsified anything, you would definitely have recourse with the MVSABC. \n\nEven if your wife was actually \"just\" a cosigner, ithe wouldn't matter anyway because a mortgage rep still has to factor that into your total debt servicing ratio (TDSR) because she would still be financially responsible if her sister defaulted. It's not so much the $40000, it's the monthly payment that is the issue.\n\nThe only thing that can help your wife is for her sister to pay off the loan in full, either with cash or by taking out a loan in her own name. sell 40k car, pay off loan, get sis $1000 beater like the rest of us, say good luck. I work in auto financing. Looks like dealer process the application under your wife only. I suggest to check if her car finance company does refinance or have your wife's sister finance thru a 3rd party bank or Credit Union. Good luck!  Dealer here.\n\nCall the manufacture. The dealer can lose the dealership. After working as a car salesman for a while, I came to the conclusion that co-signing is a bad idea, 100% of the time. The car buyer is able to get a car they can't afford when they should probably be looking for more basic transportation while repairing their own finances. The co-signer is on the hook for a car they don't own in the hopes that an irresponsible person they are related to makes the payments *this time*. \n\nI can't tell you how many times I lost a deal because an otherwise solid buyer found out in the booth that their credit is fucked because their dipshit nephew isn't making the payments in time. Half the time, the creditors won't even call the cosigner until they have already repossessed the car leaving them with little recourse.\n\nIf someone needs you to co-sign it's because the bank knows they aren't going to pay. Period. \n\nAs for your situation, if you are the only one on the title it's time to sell the car and tell sis to start shopping for a used Hyundai. The course of your life has now been altered by not being able to buy this home. Your sis should understand that this is a deal breaker.  [removed] Excluding any additional information I'm unaware of, long story short is your wife lied to you. Your sister in law's credit was so poor that she either still couldn't buy with your wife as a cosigner or the interest rate would still be incredibly high. The dealership explained to both of them after submitting to banks for finance their options. Your wife was the only one who signed paperwork and the payments can be setup to come out of any account. I'm not sure of your laws but what the dealership did is illegal in the U.S. It's called a straw purchase. It's never an issue when someone cosigns for someone but you can't buy a car for another person with the intent of someone else being the primary driver. You can finance a car for your kid, but you can't finance a car for your adult sister. If you looked at your sister's insurance, your wife would have to be the primary on that policy as well since the vehicle is in your wife's name. Why you don't co-sign 101. This post should be sticky.  Seems like dealer fraud... get a lawyer and go to court. This will settle to your side. I just love how almost every topic posted in a personal finance sub generally has to do with frivolous/unnecessary spending. Houses exempt, if you can't afford it in cash you can't afford it at all. It's just a shady banker.  It's normal for people to have car loans.  In the US banks do (used to?) approve a way higher home loan than I'd reasonably want to pay off.  They are just testing your mettle, or possibly trying to see how you squirm when caught \"lying\". What type of home loan are you trying to get?  Sometimes if you can show proof that the car is being paid by someone else for atleast 12 months then the underwriter will not count it against your DTI.  They usually look for cancelled checks or bank statements showing the payment.  Also you should have at least a credit score above 640. FYI, the is no legal difference between \"principal\" loan holder and \"cosigner\".  \n\nIt's a joint loan and your wife and her sister are both equally responsible.\n\nDid you think your wife wouldn't be liable for the debt if the sister didn't pay? The SIL needs to refinance or sell and purchase a car within her means. She can buy a Volkswagen diesel (40mpg, which will go over 300k miles) for almost nothing. There's not really any such thing in car financing as \"co-signing.\"  The loan is under the name of the higher credit scored person.  The whole \"co-sign\" thing is just a scam to make people thing they're just helping when in fact they're taking full responsibility for the loan because the other person doesn't have good enough credit to qualify. How much is left on the principal of the loan?  After 4 years one would expect a large chunk of it has been paid off by now.  If it's less than 8k or so, just pay it off.  I mean if you're trying to buy a house, I assume you have a down payment saved up already.  Have the sister in law agree to a personal loan or sell the vehicle and get you 8k back and tell her to F off and buy a used pos that she can afford. 1. live and learn.  realize co signing is a tremendously bad idea unless you guys are married. of course it's not really a good idea then either unless you have a prenuptial agreement that specifies what happens if you guys get divorced because most divorces are prompted by financial difficulties.  if one of you guys' siblings can't afford a needed car, and you decide you want to help them, you should buy a beater corolla and let her drive it.  honestly even your SIL would herself be in a better position by now if you had taken that action.\n\n2. going forward: pay off the debt as fast as possible.  you can either sell it or just speed up the payments from your own incomes. let her keep driving it as long as she makes payments to you guys, or not.  either way, the sooner the debt is gone the better for you.   4 years and she still owes $40000?\nWtf kind of car did she buy?  \nGet your SIL to refinance that now.   My situation was similar to this I had my dad cosign for me on a new car so I could get a lower interest rate and better payment and when they drafted the paper work they written him in as the main person and me as the cosigner.  Can you guys just go back and look at the original loan docs and see if you truly were a cosigner?  If so,  get it corrected. If you can't find the paperwork,  ask the loan company or dealership?  If they say they don't have it,  then can you say you don't owe any debt?  Like how people go to court for credit card debt and say show me the proof?  If you guys signed without reading I feel like that's a lot harder,  then just hope the SIL can refi on her own?  How could your wife not notice if she was the only one on the paperwork ? Have the institution you have the loan through show you the paperwork bc that doesn't make sense. But if she is the only one on the loan sell the vehicle or refinance to get a lower monthly payment and help her debt to income.  This may shock you, but there is actually no such thing as a co-signer. If you co-sign a loan, you are a co-borrower and if the originator absentmindedly listed your wife's name first, she is the principal loan holder. Depending on the bank this could be a simple form you need to sign, or a total refinance.\n\nHowever, regardless of her position, it will still be on her credit report as co-borrower. You'll need to provide your bank with the title of the car, showing that your sister owns it and not you, but even then because you co-signed, that's technically a credit liability. If your sister decided to stop paying tomorrow, you'd be on the hook for that 40k.\n\nMy advice would be to 1. Change your sister to primary borrower, 2. Get a copy of the title backing this up, and 3. Explain it to your bank and include 6 months worth of your sisters bank statements backing up the fact that she is the one responsible for payments. If the bank portfolios their mortgages, they'll more than likely make exceptions. Hopefully the institution you're dealing with is either a community bank or a credit union. LPT: it's never a cosign. They start by asking for a cosigner and almost always strong arm the parties into making that person the primary. This is probably going to get buried but if your looking for a home loan you can get the payment taken out of the DTI if your sister can show she's been making the payments for 12 months.  I have this happen a lot.  Assuming she lives seperately from you and there is a paper trail of the money going from her account to the lien holder this should be able to remove it from your DTI.   It's good that she's been making the payments.  You should know that cosigner is a primary holder of the principal.  You're not vouching for someone with a cosign, you're agreeing to pay the debt.\n\nIt's possible her sil credit was so bad, that only your wife could get approved for the loan.  They may have went ahead with that in the paper work without discussing it.\n\nLong story short, that is your car. To everyone reading: This is why you never co-sign loans for friends and family. Just. Say. No.\n\nIt will screw up your credit.  Banks specialize in giving loans, and if the bank won't give your loved one a loan, it is for a reason.\n \nAnd, as for this situation, this woman clearly did not need a vehicle this expensive.  Your wife has been played big time.  If after 4 years there is still a 40k balance, there is some serious bullshit to this, even if another car loan was added on.   If you can't get financing on a car without a co signer you don't need the car. Let that be the lesson here folks.  I am a mortgage broker, typically if you can prove 12 months history that your sister in law makes the payments via bank statements or canceled checks we can exclude that from DTI.  If an extra 40,000 of carried debt is preventing you from pre-qualifying for a mortgage there is something else wrong.  Either the cost of the expected house is too high, your credit is too weak, or income is too low.  Get your sister in law on credit karma and have her do some reading on improving her credit score.  Go to a credit union and refinance her car loan in her name as soon as she can.  She is probably underwater with a high interest rate right now so this may be impossible without bringing cash to the table.  This will help her score, get your wife off the original loan, free up your debt/income ratio, and hopefully get her a better rate.   This isn't uncommon, unfortunately: if one person qualifies by themselves it's faster & easier to just file the loan with them exclusively. This happens with credit card applications as well, frequently the wife discovers she was never the joint owner of a credit card, only a second card holder, and has no credit standing.\n\nThe best thing to do is refinance the car loan with a reputable bank or credit union (do they have those in Canada?) with both sisters listed. You SIL will begin building positive credit history and it should reduce your family's total indebtedness a bit.\n\nAs mentioned above, anyone who thinks they have a jointly assumed debt should use the free annualcreditreport.com (usa) website to check the facts.  Read your original loan application documents carefully again. They will clearly indicate who the borrower(s) are. At least see if your wife's sister's name appears in the documents in any capacity?\n\nIf only your wife's name appears on the application and origination paperwork you spent the afternoon at the dealership filling out, then you should get in contact with the lender to ask if they can write a new loan under the same terms as the previous, but reflecting your sister as a co-signer. Offer to show them the original loan paperwork indicating two borrowers and ask if they can correct it, including retroactive reporting to benefit your SIL's credit score.\n\nThe fact there's 4 years of timely payment history on the account will make it much easier to negotiate with financial insitutitions.\n\nAs for you wife's credit score and history, a co-signer is fully responsible for the loan along with the other signer. Both people are individually and jointly responsible for the timely fulfillment of the terms of the loan, and because your wife could be fully responsible for it on her own if her sister fails to pay, it's correct that it would show up on your wife's credit report as a loan she owns. A co-signed loan attaches to both signers equally. The bank does not care that one person is the principal, they are both legally obligated guarantors of the terms of the loan.\n\nJust saw where you think the loan amount is wrong and you paid for two cars -- again, read your originating loan and purchasing paperwork carefully. All of those numbers are there. If there's a discrepancy in the amount financed on that paperwork vs. what the lender thinks was financed, you have a case to argue to get it corrected as you did not agree to borrow anything beyond what you agreed to and signed on the loan paperwork.\n And this is why you never ever cosign a loan.  Ever.\n Whoever has the better credit score is put as the main. Doesn't really matter. Anything negative or positive that comes from the  loan happens to both the main person and co-signer.  Moral of the story- never co-sign anything. If someone needs a co-signer, they can't afford it in the first place 40k on a car? I would have to make 250k to be OK with that.  Best of luck. Whatever the end result, I'm sure you and your wife have learned a valuable lesson through all of this.  It could've been a lot worse.   Jesus Christ this comment thread is full of vitriol. I'm sorry you had to read all this crap OP.  There is however some truly good advice amidst the crap. Best of luck getting this resolved! \n\nFor my own two cents, if your SIL can afford it I would say getting her to pay off the loan in full ahead of schedule would be the best bet. And at the same time I would go find that loan paperwork and find out why your SIL didn't end up on the loan at all, it sounds like she needed the boost from the good payment history more than anything.  Holy shit 40k for a fucking car? If she desperately needed a car she could buy some old used car for $1000-$4000, like a Nissan Micra or something. Doesnt cost shit but will work fine. No need to buy some stupid luxury Mercedes if you can't afford it. As everyone else is saying , as to your wife's legal responsibility for the loan , how the loan is written does not matter. \n\nYour wife is just as liable for the loan as the primary as if she was the co-signer. \n\n\nBut into the dealer side of things .... \n\nNot really sure if its any different up in can , but here in the states a dealer can \"take points on the loan\" . Meaning they can actually take a loan that 'should be' 1.5 and bump that to 1.9 and keep the .4 for themselves. \n\nIf they are permitted to do that in can. Its very likely that they wrote it this way in order to charge the apr your sil would have been paying on a loan thats actually getting your wife's lower apr and keeping the difference for themselves. \n\n Perhaps try getting a rental agreement from your SIL. I have a 2nd house my wife used to live in. When we got married and choose to buy a new house, the loan officer denied us because we didn't want to sell our other house. We wanted to keep it as a rental. As soon as we produced a rental agreement showing that someone else would be servicing that loan, they didn't count it on our debt to income ratio and we were approved for a new house. So now we own 2 homes and someone pays our marriage on the first one. Maybe you can do that with the car. Get a rental/lease agreement to show that someone else makes the payment and the underwriter will ignore that loan  If it's 4 years out..... how much balance is left on the loan??\n\nIs it something that could simply be paid off so you can move on?\n\nCan your SIL apply for a refinancing loan to get your wife off of it? Is the balance low enough that SIL could finally qualify to borrow money?\n\nDo you have copies of the loan paperwork anywhere? Have you reviewed them? If you can't afford to pay off the car in 3 or 4 years, you can't afford the car. One thing I'm confused about though. Why is having a car payment messing up your ability to get a mortgage? If payments have been going well for four years then the car should be close to paid off. If that single thing is throwing off your owe/own ratio that much then it makes me think there are other things that could be contributing to it. Tangent question: If OP's wife wrote a check today to pay off the loan completely, would she have ownership of the car?  It is my understanding that she would not because she is merely the co-signer, and therefore her sister would own the car outright. It seems everyone is focusing on the auto/sister-in-law loan, but how much could be left on 40k after four years?  The remaining balance can't be that detrimental to your ratio, can it?  Are you shooting too high on the house purchase price target for what you can afford?  Or is there still 40k remaining on that vehicle loan? I work for a Canadian bank as a Financial Advisor.\n\nI run into this problem all the time with my clients.  Even as a co-signer on the loan, you are still on the hook for it, thus banks will calculate 100% of the monthly payment into your TDSR (the ratio between income and all debt payments). \n\nCanadian banks (at least the I bank work at) have a tendency to presume worst case scenarios in order to mitigate risk. Do you not have any contract or documentation that your wife agreed to be a co-signer and why such a high loan amount? Even though she's still 100% liable as such, I think that's the bigger issue that should be looked at. If they're giving you a higher rate or price on the car because of your SIL's credit, she should be on the loan. If your wife's credit was the only one used for the loan to get the car, there should be no penalty. \n\nMy ideas: \n\n1. SIL Refi's the car in her name only \n\n2. If she doesn't qualify, ask your lender if you showed them that she's made xx months history worth of payments on time, could exclude it from your debt to income ratio. \n\n3. If they don't allow that (probably won't), see if they would if you refinanced it into both of your names and showed that same history.  This is why you don't co-sign  This happened to me as a young adult. I bought a reasonable new car, under $16k, trying to build my credit. My mom cosigned for me, but the dealership fudged the paperwork. I didn't find out for like 2 years. \n\nThis is going to cause more problems than just the loan in your wifes name. \n\n- The car is licensed in your wifes name. You sister has no legal right to that car. She can not legally sell it with out your wife. \n\n- If the title gets transferred over to your sisters name your sister may have to pay any extra taxes and fees (I don't know Canadian vehicle law or gift tax law). I had to pay an extra $5k on a car that I already owned in sales tax when I finally transferred the title over to my name. \n\n- Legal fees and time for a legal battle if you guys decide to bring a lawsuit against them. \n\n- If, god forbid, anything were to happen to your sister before this is all straightened out you and your wife are principal signers on this loan and you're on the hook for this. \n\nYou guys need to get this straightened out right away. Go on over to /r/legaladvice and get some better advice there.  Regardless of if she's a cosigner or the \"principal loan holder,\" either way your wife is financially responsible for the loan, and that payment will be included in her debt to income ratio. This is why you shouldn't sign for other people to get loans.\n\nBut either way, whether or not her sister is on the loan, your wife would still have it reflected on her credit, and *anything* on her credit is included in her debt to income ratio. Car companies are no longer in the car business but the loan business. Prices on cars are going up and so are loans (84-96 month loans) which seem to be the norm now. Banks and car companies know your going to trade that car in well before its paid off and push negative equity on your next insanely long loan. This is just asking for financial hell in the next 10 years.....  I sold cars once upon a time. The only way to get the loan done was to leave the sister off; otherwise, the banks wouldn't touch it. There are some dealerships that tell you this straight up (like the one I worked for) and others that don't tell you anything. Sometimes they tell you if you ask and other times they just straight lie. It could be that they said \"we got you approved\" and if no one asked how then they didn't tell.  You could try suing the dealer for lying but It would be hard to prove, at least in the US. The guy did fudge the paper work that's how co-signed loans work. The person that is the main co-signer (your wife) is basically the main holder of the loan. They use her credit to approve the loan making her the responsible one for the loan to be paid. Your sister is just making the payment but it does not affect her credit in anyway. Any financial institution should of explained how a co-signed loan works. If your sister wants to improve her credit she should look at a 500 prepaid credit card from the bank and just put her cellphone bill on it and make she pays it each month until her score improves.  It doesn't matter if you are a co signer or primary loan holder, it goes against your ability to borrow, because if the primary doesn't pay then the co signer must.  Co signing is like taking out the loan yourself, affects your ability to borrow and your debt ratio Unless your wife agreed, she shouldn't have been able to add another car into that loan. My wife is new to the country, credit and driving and she was able to get 3.95% on a 2012 she bought 2 weeks ago. I thought that was pretty good considering she'd only been added to my cards as an authorized user and didn't have any other credit to speak of. These 1.x% rates I'm seeing make me want to get myself a new ride after we pay hers off but mine is almost 25 and still runs like 92 so fuck that.  Where did you get the car from in bc?\n\nMaybe she could refinance it now and put some money down ?  From the story and the comments you've made the way I understand it is your SIL purchased a new vehicle 4+ yrs ago with your wife as a co-signer and before the vehicle had been completely paid off she purchased a new vehicle rolling over the previous balance of the original vehicle. Did your wife co-sign for the new vehicle? Did the dealership just use her credit and name without consent? That would be my question to the lending institution! I'm not familiar with how the lending companies work here in Canada but I do know they can't add debt or transfer debt without consent from the original co-signer unless it was a line of credit. Does the original documents your wife signed say this? It should be investigated. I mean, how did they also manage to put sisters existing debt in with the new loan if it was going under your wife's? \n When they won't give you a loan without a co-signer, that means they don't expect you to pay. No good dead goes unpunished. Oh that's smart. I'll definitely check that out, has is actually in my 5% rotating rewards right now and I'll never hit the $1500 limit on my own.

I was pretty reckless and got myself into a terrible financial situation (credit cards, credit loans, you name it). This friend was worse off than me due to medical bills, etc, and was beginning a graduate program. She asked me to co-sign a student loan, to which I did because my credit was fucked and I did not give a shit about the future (apparently). She asked me to re-up twice and I did. This was a combination of being a young (stupid) person and having a very manipulative friendship that did not end well. \n\nThis person and I have not spoken in 4 years. I'm currently 27, in my first year in a doctoral graduate program. I was able to work my way out of nearly all of my debt (except for my ever-increasing student loan debt), including rebuilding my credit with a secured credit card! Yay me. \n\nBut I received a letter in the mail today that reminded me about this past co-signature. It said that she was delinquent on payments. This is the first time I have received anything. I don't know anything about what is happening with this person. She was a toxic presence in my life and I do not keep in any kind of touch. However, just as I'm starting to think about the future and become a responsible adult, I'm reminded about the possibility of this person fucking my life up (all over again, but that's another story). \n\nIn doing some Google research I found nothing but hopelessness. What is my best case scenario (other than that she has gotten her act together and pays everything off without any worries)? I just need to have a realistic perspective on what my future could look like.

Because I care so much about you, I want to help.  Here is $2,000, why don't we sit down and refinance.  I will help you fill out the Sofi or Lending Club or Prosper paperwork.  Oh, you need some cash now and don't want it to go to the loan.....okay, but only after you refinance and pay off the original loan.\"\n\nThis absolutely rewards her bad behavior with cash, but at least it gets you off the hook for the debt. You are 100% responsible for the loans you signed for her.\n\nBe ready to have to pay them. Not much you can do to get out of this situation. Hopefully you didn't do anything too stupid like cosign for 100K. Never cosign for anyone ever again for any reason. Start saving up and try to see if you can locate her and have her help deal with this. Otherwise use the money saved and start making payments. See if maybe you can take her to court or whatever  You will be on the hook for this debt. How much in total did you sign for? Hopefully its not too much. 15k is an expensive lesson, but not a life-shattering one. Like you said, \"Chump Change\" compared to a 200k Private School education. Even young you wasn't *that* foolish, so don't beat yourself up too much.  Best case scenario is you call the company you owe money to, give them a sob story, and they settle for less. My grandmom always told me: You will never get it back from the person you gave it, but there will be other who will help you, like you helped. ( Hope this makes sense in english. Im sorry for my english. It's even hard to say this in german.) Also be proud of yourself for helping others, even thought this person wasn't worth your effort. Pay this 15k$ for your Karma. You did nothing wrong. Hope you will be able to trust a friend again. Don't listen to anyone who tells you you're screwed.

If the original amount was $15k, but she hasn't been paying and they keep adding on it could easily become $30k or more.\n\nAnd, as you've probably heard, college loans can't be resolved by bankruptcy. Yeesh, you're screwed. You owe whatever she owes.\n\nGood on you for trying to be a good friend, I suppose, but lesson learned here. Before you give up on getting out of the loan you may want to see what kind of evidence you have about your discussions regarding the co-signing of the loan (if there are any emails, facebook messages, etc). If you have anything solid supporting manipulation it might be worth getting a lawyer (if your school has a law school they may have a free legal clinic) to look it over to see if it would qualify as unconscionably or duress. If she makes promises to you that she hasn't kept she may be guilty of fraud.  In the U.S., student loans are about the only debt which cannot be discharged through bankruptcy. Additionally, many states deny and/or revoke professional licenses if the licensee is delinquent on a student loan.\n\nYou are definitely in a difficult place likely for a very long time. I would give her a call and ask her for a co-signer release. If that does not work and they come after you file a cross-complaint. This makes it so you can go after her.  \n\nSorry this happened but everyone is right at least it is 15k and not 100k.\n\nGood luck! [removed] [removed] Seeing how you are responsible for the loans it might be worth it to reach out to the person that you signed for. Perhaps a little helping hand will get her back into a place where she can continue paying the loans.\n\nAlternatively if you brush up on the laws and procedures to remove yourself from this debt, then maybe you can find a creative path to getting this lady to sign off on you exiting the agreement. If she is that hard up for money maybe the threat of having to hire a lawyer to protect herself from your lawyer would be enough for her to help get you out of paying for her loan.\n\nThere's likely no easy way out of this but if it were me I would try everything so could to get out of paying it. If 40 hours later it was looking bleak I might just find a night job and serve tables or bartend 15 hours a week for the next year to pay it. Depending on the circumstances of you signing you could consult with a lawyer about seeking some sort of judgment removing you.  This would probably only work if you could make the case that you were conned into signing the paperwork.  Probably a long shot but worth thinking about. I'm surprised you qualified as a co-signer for her.  Well I guess you know now to never co-sign for anyone again. My parents co-signed for my brother and when he didn't pay they started taking the money out of my parent's bank account. So now they can't have a lot of money in there or else it'll be gone.  So be aware of that possibly happening to you and don't keep everything in your account. Certainly see an attorney if you can. Meantime here's a website that helped me recently: https://www.avvo.com/. I posted a question and received some legal advice from 4 attorneys within a few hours, and even went back and forth a couple of times via email with followup questions. It was free and pretty amazing. \n\nRE you're being screwed, however: The purpose of co-signing a loan, in the eyes of the lender, is so they have an alternative source to collect on the debt should the original borrower fail on his obligation, a transaction that would not have happened in the first place without your co-signing. While this is probably stating the obvious, it's not the lender who's the bad guy. They're just doing what it is they do. Good luck!   \n\nhttps://youtu.be/gB3uvFA8-_c Yes. The dangerous part of co signing is you're liable when your former friend doesn't pay. Some ways to help you out of it -- http://www.daveramsey.com/mobile/truth-about-detail/storyID/the%2Dtruth%2Dabout%2Ddebt%2Dand%2Drelationships/\n\n\nDepending on the cost of the loan, I'd see what the lender would take as a settlement to pay it in full. Example-- if you asked them what the amount to pay in full would be and they said $5000, I'd say save like crazy to send them a one time payment of that 5K, but if you go that route get it IN WRITING (or email and print it) saying the 5K payment clears you of that loan. Then keep that paper for the rest of your life because other lenders may come back years later and say you owe XYZ loan and you'll need that paper as proof.\n\nI hope that is clear and helpful. Consigning is not a smart choice for anything and I'm sorry you're facing this. :-(\n\nEDIT-- NEVER give a lender electronic access to your bank accounts. NEVER!! Because they may withdraw your entire account and be deceptive like that.  This is one for Judge Judy for sure  One useful thing you could do is check your credit report.  This can be done free from all 3 major bureaus at [annualcreditreport.com](http://www.annualcreditreport.com), which is a free, government-mandated service offered so that folks can see what is on their credit report.  The way it works is you put in your SSN, you answer some questions to verify your ID, and then you're taken to each bureau's website in turn; each one will spit out a credit report and you can read through them and download a copy.\n\nThese loans will certainly appear there.  You can see what their payment history looks like - student loan histories go back 10 years in the credit bureaus, I think - and you can see how delinquent they are, how many loans there are, who is currently servicing these loans, what the current amount owed on each one is, et cetera.\n\nThe more information you have, the better you'll be able to figure out your next step. Not sure about the USA. But here, a loan guarantee of that nature would require the lender to ensure that the guarantor received independent legal advice as to the effects of the loan. Otherwise the guarantor could raise a defence of \"undue influence\". A situation like this almost screams undue influence. It is highly irregular for someone in their late teens / early twenties to guarantee a substantial loan for someone twice their age, who they are not related to. If you signed without receiving independent legal advice, I'd have a chat to a lawyer. Legally you are 100% responsible for that loan. Nevertheless, I would talk to a layer, there is a remote possibility to charge her with fraud and then use it as the bargaining chip so she takes over the loan entirely and releases you from it.\n\nJust talk to a layer and see what he says, first consultations are often free.\n You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Student Loans wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/studentloans)\n- [\"How to handle $\"](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics)\n- [What's the best way to pay down my debt?](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/debt#wiki_what.27s_the_best_way_to_pay_down_my_debt.3F)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.

There is nothing a law firm can do for you that you can't do for yourself.\n\nPile up some cash. Make sure it's out of reach of your creditors. Not sure if a bank levy is a thing in Texas.

You can even file Chapter 13 with current pending lawsuits or even judgements.\n The statute of limitations stops when a lawsuit is filed, so I'm not sure what that law firm is charging you 25% for.  If the debt is within the statute of limitations, and you know it's yours, and you don't want to pay it then engaging the debt collector is like poking a sleeping bear -- don't do it.\n\nI like your current strategy of settling after being sued if it's obvious you can't win.

Based on your limited description it's very difficult to know exactly what the employer is asking, what their rationale is, and whether it might be legal to ask for.  \n  \nAs far as not getting calls back, there's no central \"record\" system for employers.  Potential employers may be (probably are) calling her previous employer for references.  A lot of companies these days will barely give anything out to another employer in an attempt to limit their liability anyway, but just giving her dates of employment and saying that she isn't eligible for re-hire may be enough to discourage a new employer from setting up an interview.  There's not a ton you can do about that, other than keep applying and working on the resume/cover letter. Did she sign an employee contract? Did she sign anything when she was fired saying she would pay them back? Was she charged criminally? There is no such thing as a \"permanent record\" other than a criminal record and a credit record. Does she have ant other work experience. Nothing says you have to put a job on your resume/application that you were fired from. You would just have an gap in your employment. Being a minor at the time may just get her out of this since minors can't be held long liable contractually. Oh, now that she is legally an adult, she really needs to never do that again. She can now be charged with theft and that can screw for a long time.  There seem to be two questions here:\nThe first is explicit, what would happen if she doesn't pay (which I think other commenters have addressed) \nand second (which you never explicitly asked, but I gathered from your line about companies bullying you into paying money) about the fairness of asking for $400 for stealing $100.  This does not seem like bullying to me.  If the monetary punishment were $100 for stealing $100, then some people may weigh paying a guaranteed $100 vs possibly being slapped with a $100 fine. Rinse and repeat for increasing increments of money and try to find a minimum amount where the fine is an effective deterrent.  This is honestly chump change vs filing a police report.

What I've seen on reddit is 'what kind of car can I afford' when someone's presumably going to hold onto it. I'm currently commuting an hour to a career-type job, but I don't know how long this role is going to last. One of the criteria for my next position is that it be reachable with transit, since I live somewhere with a dense, accessible network of subways. In the meantime, I need a car. \n\nI'm looking at buying a used ILX ($12,000). For comparison, I can see a 2013 civic EX-L with 35k miles advertised at $11,395, and the same year/mileage ILX is at $11,995. I'm looking for a car with about 50-70k, incidentally, so a little less.\n\nOne of my concerns is that I haven't considered all available options:\n\n-Public transit-- would not arrive at work until late morning. Also, would cost about $500/month because it's the commuter train.\n\n-Beater car-- since my commute is so long, and I've already wrecked (repairs vastly more than the car is worth) two 2003 beater cars on it, including one Accord, I think I need a more robust, higher-quality vehicle. 10-15 year old cars are just not made to drive 70 mph (the far-right lane speed) two hours a day, at least in my natural experience. Also, I don't know where you all are finding $3,500 Accords under 100k miles. Those cost at least twice that near me.\n\n-Renting (Hertz, Avis, etc)-- I'm 24, so this worked out to about $3,000/month. \n\n-Smaller (subcompact) cars-- this is me being fussy, but I just don't feel safe in them with semis passing at 85 in the dark. While it's raining. And yes, I'm fully aware that if one of them jackknifes, it will take out a midsize/subcompact car with equal impunity. This is an emotional decision. \n\n-Leasing-- Given the additional expense of a one-year vs. typical three-year lease, plus the fact that I drive 21,000 miles a year, the pricing on this also wound up being impractical. I couldn't find any lease takeovers near me that would work either. \n\nSince I'm not planning on staying in this car long term, is there anything else I should be thinking of?

Expect to resell in your calculations and you should be able to pick out the right honda, toyota, nissan, or subaru. > -Renting (Hertz, Avis, etc)-- I'm 24, so this worked out to about $3,000/month.\n\nJesus. I rented a car for a *year* at less than that price. The tranny in the V6 accords of that era (most v6 hondas for that matter) was inferior to other eras. But the engine should have no problem lasting 250-300K.  70MPH for two hours should be cake for most Hondas and Toyotas. Stick with those guys. don't get a car. get a scooter. (cause it's short term) The obvious choice is a subcompact/beater. You can get a well maintained mid 2000s Saturn (just an example, plenty of great cars in this price range) with 100k miles for under $2,500. 5spd and 35mpg. Plenty reliable with nothing but oil changes/tune ups, your anecdotal evidence of not being able to withstand literally what they were built for means very little to me (4 yr pro mechanic 11 yr amateur, whatever that's worth to you.)\n\n**in pf we thrive by eliminating the emotional aspect of spending money,** that's almost literally the sub's mantra. If you're going to be emotional, you're going to lose money. Suck it up with your gut or with your wallet. you gotta disconnect those two parts of your brain to make smart financial moves.\n\nAlso, might I suggest, a motorcycle is a frugal choice. A ninja 500 for example gets 70mpg, costs under $2,000, and is notoriously reliable. I can respect you not wanting to go down that avenue though, but there's a reason lower income nations are crawling with scooters and small cc bikes. Financially it just makes sense. Scooters would serve you better, but tbh one made for hour commutes at highway speed are going to cost as much as a bike and return identical mileage. During warm months my monthly gas budget is $50, during winter it's closer to $180 (60 mile commute)\n\nI should reinforce though: I am a former mechanic. I work on all my own stuff, and am currently driving cars that I bought non running, so it's easy for me to take a slight risk in reliability when I've got $8,000 in tools in my garage. Especially knowing that before they get on the road, literally every fluid and filter was changed.

Cars aren't an investment at all (with the exception of some classics, and then you're talking well out of the $5k range). \n\nThe old adage \"you get what you pay for\" is often true with cars, but you don't have to spend $20k to get something reliable. Do your research, look at reliability ratings. If reliability is your main concern, look foreign - Japanese in particular. \n\nYou might want to check in /r/cartalk or a similar subreddit.  Look for a late 90's/early 2k's Honda. They are cheap as shit to fix, don't have super intricate computers, tires are cheap. The engines last forever.\n\n5k would get you a damn good one.\n\nYou won't be cruising down main street making panties drop, but with shit credit and limited funds, you need to make sure you're good for the future, not that you can get laid. You can get a decent Honda my  whole family drives them not the best looking but amazing gas mileage and you can drive them for a long ass time if taken care of  I have a 2004 pontiac grand am I bought for $2000 4 or 5 years ago and it's still truckin with minimal repairs. Is it going to last much longer? No, will probably have to look in a year or so. But $2000 for a 6 years is alright. You can get a way better car if you're putting $5-$10k into it. If you're trying to be financially savvy about, then pick the maximum you want to spend without a payment and then do your research on the most reliable cars in that price range. Then start looking around for those models/years in your area. In the last 15 years, i've driven used cars i found on craigslist, and the most expensive one was $3,600, but i'd usually buy cars in the $2,000 range. They were the cheapest cars to own when you consider total cost of ownership because the cars were close to being fully depreciated by the previous owners, but each gave me anywhere from 50,000-100,000 miles of service. \n\nAlso, for older models.. parts are usually at their cheapest.. especially as aftermarket suppliers start liquidating their stocks of parts when the vehicle reaches 20+ years of age.\n\nBuying an older car and keeping it running is literally the cheapest way to run a car, all costs included. I'll give you one example of this..\n\nMy best score was a 1996 Nissan 200SX SE-R. It had 220,000 miles on it and i bought it for $2000. I put $2000 into maintenance over the car's life ( it needed $1000 upfront! ), drove it for 5 years, put 80,000 miles on it, and sold it for $1000 in 2014.\n\nAll in all, the car cost me $3000 over a 5 year span. That's $600 a year. That's $50 a month.\n\nRecently i purchased a 1997 Nissan Maxima with 220,000 miles again. The car cost me $1,000 upfront, and i put $2,000 into it in order to keep it running for another 5 years. I'm on year 2 and the car is super solid and has no issues and runs fantastic for a 20 year old! I fully expect this car to last me the 5 years i am committed into owning it.\n\nAlso, no car is an investment unless you are buying a 'classic car'.. all cars otherwise are depreciating assets that have a cost per mile. And the period which a car is under a warranty is actually the most expensive due to the depreciation being the highest. Both my and my SO's vehicles are reliable and safe vehicles that we each got for under $3k and $6k, respectively.  I highly suggest Toyota, because if you keep up on regular maintenance, you can drive it for a very long time.  Even with my 2000 model, I've gotten reliability and longevity, and, tbh, warranties are not really worth much unless you get a lemon to begin with.\n\nI suggest purchasing from a private seller (we spent a lot of time on craigslist looking at vehicles), and make sure to take the vehicle to a trusted mechanic for an inspection before buying.  The most reliable options will be \"one owner\" cars (they'll know the entire history of the car), so try to look for those too.  No one here has asked what you need this car for? I would have vastly different advice for different applications.\n\nLong Highway drives a must? (borrow $6,000-12,000 \"buy New\" with good gas mileage)\nhttp://www.autobytel.com/top-10-cars/least-expensive-cars/?id=22650&gclid=Cj0KEQiAwrbEBRDqxqzMsrTGmogBEiQAeSE6ZYTRFJhtAKOEXL71f_UT4tKoMjX8TWZhzdXLJJaHNOsaArCq8P8HAQ\n\nShort commutes? (grandpap car $3000)\nIs public transport an option? (beater $2000) if it breaks, take the bus for a week.\nrural Salt on the roads? Beater Y2K-2005 +(less rust)\n\nDon't buy for lifestyle, \"big buck & Bass\" or not, Honda's run better and take less gas than pick up trucks/ 4x4 that you use 5 times a year. Buy a car for what you do not what you wish you did. (this comes from a guy who drives a Jeep with 35's so I'm a hypocrite)\n\nIf you said I must go hunting I would own a Honda and a dirt bike not a pick up truck. dirt bikes go anywhere and are $1500 on craigslist.\n\n I love my cheap ass 2017 Mitsubishi Mirage. Great car. If you absolutely have to buy new with a warranty I highly recommend it. With a 5000 down payment you'd have a tiny monthly car payment. Up to 45 mpg and a 5 year b2b warranty doesn't hurt either. I spend about $15-18 a week on gas commuting 30+ miles a day. Otherwise a used Toyota Echo, Civic, or even a Buick Le Sabre would be reliable choices-those were my alternate choices when looking for a cheap reliable car.  I've done both ways, I would go with the down payment/reliable car route if you can afford the payment and insurance. I know a car is a terrible investment and always loses a ton of value but the peace of mind of a car that starts and won't leave you stranded on highway is incalculable. Peace of mind always wins. I just bought 2007 Suzuki and it's fab. You can most definitely get a good car for you price range, sounds like you need to readjust your expectations though. \n\nFor what it's worth, my previous car was ~$3k and was an awesome wee car. Only reason I don't still have it is because a certain dickhead put it in a ditch for me. Sounds like the newest, lowest mileage Camry or Accord you can find is in your future. Safe for the kids, fuel efficient, and reliable.  I had a reliable 2001 Pontiac Grand Am for 900. That is until it got hit in the driver side door and almost took my leg off. Buy a good motorcycle instead  $5,500 would get you a near new bike  if you don't want the car payment, pay it fast n furiously off. getting a beater will leave you in the same position a few years down the road. if you're okay with cycling out beater cars then do that. getting a slightly newer car than can withstand the test of time or last at least 2x as long as a beater will probably be a better outlook.

Third option roll it over into self directed IRA. Probably best choice if he follows directives Warren Buffet gave for his wife's retirement put it all into a market based ETF or mutual fund. Meaning no individual stocks a low expense ratio total market fund invested to match performance of whole market. This will give good returns with little management  or knowledge required. Only remove money from fund as needed for expenses taking about 4% or so a year after retirement. His wife can be the beneficiary so would keep getting any benefit without reductions if he dies early. Second should continue to work and hold off retirement as long as possible to boost SS payout and allow funds to grow.  As for current debts couple options as I said sell house if he has equity use proceeds to pay off credit cards. Then find a small apartment that they can afford. Use any excess cash from home sale to establish emergency fund (6months expenses) the remainder into a roth IRA or investment account also invested in market ETF. Switch to cash (do not seem able to handle credit) make some small credit purchases each month that are totally paid off each month. This will restore their credit rating.

That way, when you get the proceeds from you sale you can pay off the HELOC.  The downside to this is that a HELOC will be a variable rate (and likely a higher rate) so there's more risk involved if you don't pay it off.\n\nFor example, say you are buying a $100k house with $10k down and you expect $20k from proceeds of the sale.  Ask the lender to do $70k on the mortgage and $20k on the HELOC.  When you get the proceed, pay off the $20k.\n\nYou may really have to shop around for this.  And you will have to find someone who does HELOC's at 90% LTV....many are only going up to 80% nowadays. > it will probably work out that we buy our next house before our current one sells/closes\n\nThis is risky.\n\n> I can afford the new mortgage with this down payment, but would be much more comfortable if I could plow the proceeds into it as well. \n\nProceeds of what?

Read [this](http://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2012/01/23/the-backdoor-roth-ira-advanced-version/#405a68175556) and [this](http://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/backdoor-roth-ira-tutorial/).\n\n> 2\\. where should I allocate money (savings account seems terribly inefficient yielding 0.50%)?\n\nFollow the advice in [\"How to handle $\"](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics) and the [Windfall wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/windfall).\n\nHigh level (simplified somewhat, read those pages carefully and thoroughly):\n\n1. Fund your emergency fund to 9-12 months of expenses because your income is variable.\n2. Max 401(k).\n3. Max backdoor Roth IRA (caveats above).\n4. Bring total retirement savings up to at least 15%-20% of annual income (much higher should be easy for you, though) even if it means a taxable account for the last portion.\n5. Save more into taxable for retirement or other future goals.\n\nInvest in the 401(k), Roth IRA, and taxable using a [three-fund portfolio](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Three-fund_portfolio) approach.\n\n> 3\\. any advice for breaking my extremely low risk tolerance?\n\nI'd suggest a higher overall bond allocation like 25% or even 30% to level out your volatility, but you need to get out of gold and savings and invest in *both* stocks and bonds.  Stocks and bonds compound faster than inflation.  Savings accounts and precious metals do not (yes, precious metals can go up faster than inflation, but it is only over short periods of time).\n\nI would also get more educated.  Read one of the Bogleheads books in the subreddit reading list.\n\n> 4\\. are there any tax advantages to owning undeveloped land (financed or cash purchase)?\n\nNot particularly, no.  You really need to break out of these weird ideas.\n\n> 5\\. Is it worth meeting with a financial adviser if I have no desire to invest in equities?\n\nYes... because you should invest into equities.  I mean, seriously, you're employed by a company.  You buy products from companies.  Companies make money and you're missing out on it.\n\nYou might consider going with a service like Vanguard Personal Advisor Services (just 0.3% a year) and let them manage your money for you.  They will even adjust your allocation based on your risk tolerance.\n\nYou could easily save enough money, if you invest it, to [retire in the near future](http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2012/01/13/the-shockingly-simple-math-behind-early-retirement/), but you have to get over your past experiences.\n If you're really hardcore risk-adverse there is always CDs and bonds. You might have incorrectly formatted line breaks. To create a line break, either put two spaces at the end of the line or put an extra blank line in-between lines.

If I was earning your money I would be buying 4-5 real estates off her each year. This level of money is way past general reddit financial advice. You should be paying good money for proper advice. I think one question that you need to address is: What kind of lifestyle do you want/expect?\n\nAfter the next three years you could easily have 2.5 million dollars in assets. Invested somewhere near 60% equities and 40% bonds (fairly conservative for your age), you could re-invest enough of your growth to match inflation every year and then still have $50k left to live off of.\n\nThere are many people that would be happy to have an income of $50k, but make much less. There are many people that *do* have an income of $50k and live a good life that they are satisfied with.\n\nThat's just something I think you should consider. In general, my advice to you would be to either find a stable job you're currently qualified for or go back to school to get trained in something (also stable) that you'd enjoy doing as a long term career.\n\nThen, invest this money (again, at least 70% in equities would be preferable) and don't touch it. Live off of your new, stable job's stable income. Your multi-million dollar investment made before hitting 30 should allow you to retire comfortably by the time you're 50, if you're willing to live like a normal, reasonable person.\n\nIf you want to live in a gold plated mansion then my only advice is to hold on to your current job for as long as you can and hope for the best.\n\n(Seriously though I just did the math and $2mil invested from age 30  with a *very* conservative 5% growth rate would yield $4.4mil at age 50. 10 million at age 67.

My family moved to the US back in 2001 and they both spent all their money/time to put my sister and I through college. However, the downside is that my parents lived paycheck to paycheck and basically expect to continue doing so for the next 20-30 years.\n\nMy dad has no retirement whatsoever. My mom has various accounts, which total around $50-55k:\n\nOld job: \n\n* 401(a) and 403(b). She has taken a loan of $18k out of one of these that she is currently repaying.\n\nNew job: \n\n* LACERA pension account (4% automatic investment)\n* Voluntary Retirement account - has two options: 401k and Horizon plan (current pick - 100% match up to 4% which is what she does)\n\nAt the moment, they cannot afford to put any more money into her retirement. They live paycheck to paycheck supporting the two of them, my sister and my grandma. They owe about $20-30k in student loans for my mom, $5-6k credit card debt, $400k mortgage. They have 3 cars, but I pay for those for them.\n\nI live in another state and am saving up for my own retirement + investments.\n\nWhat are our options here? \n\n* Should I avoid saving up my own 401k in order to have available assets in the near future to help them when the time comes? \n* Can I gift money to them, which they can put into the retirement account for the tax-free growth? She's over 50, so she can use up the catch-up contribution as well. Does this even make sense? What happens with the 401k money in case of inheritance? Will it be double taxed when coming back to me due to inheritance?\n* Should I help her pay back the $18k loan from her 401k so it can start compounding?\n* I guess the better question is, what should they be investing in? Since their retirement account is so low, does it make sense to keep it in riskier stocks for quicker growth? OR should they be settling into bonds at this point of their lives? Her current elections have high fees, so I need to shuffle things around, however I'm not sure what to pick.\n* Can we count on Social Security for both of them by the age of 65?\n\nThank you all for any advice or insight.

Just a few general observations:\n\n- They probably can't afford to have 3 cars. If you didn't make all those payments, you would be a lot better off.\n\n- Make paying off the credit cards, and then the 401k loan, as a priority. 401k loans are generally bad--you're paying back pretax dollars with aftertax dollars, and if you lose your job, the whole loan is often due.\n\n- You can gift them money to fund Roth IRA's (401a and 403b have to be funded through payroll deductions). This may be a good idea since your parents might qualify for the Retirement Savers Tax Credit.\n\n- 401k money is not double taxed in an inheritance. It is taxed once when you withdraw it, because it was contributed as pretax dollars. With a low income, your parents should generally be making Roth contributions whenever possible.\n\n- Taking a lot of risk to try to \"catch up\" is unwise. I would recommend a balanced portfolio, maybe 60-70% stocks and 30-40% bonds. If you post the investment options, I can recommend something. You want to look for low-cost index funds (this is also true of a Roth IRA, there are good options available at Schwab/Vanguard/Fidelity).\n\n- If they have paid into Social Security for at least 10 years, they are eligible for a benefit. Social Security isn't going to go away. Because they have so little saved, they should plan to retire at 70 to take advantage of the rapid compound growth on deferred Social Security (8% per year) while saving even more money.

I am 31 and living in Brooklyn, NY \u2013I moved here stupidly by transferring with the same employer from Virginia Beach, VA in March of 2016. I say stupidly because as a direct result my income has stayed the same while my rent more than doubled from $450 to $985. While in VA I lived well and made good money (much lower COL) so I was doing great paying down debt but now with less money available to pay off debt I feel like it\u2019s getting worse so I\u2019m trying to minimize interest and taking on increased debt by freezing my credit cards. This has become extremely difficult because I have been out of work for the last 3 months (had total knee replacement) and living on the $3k I thankfully had in my savings. Now I\u2019ve recently returned to work so I am trying to tackle all of this before it eats me alive.    \n\nI take home about $1600 a month -- $985 of that is rent, my lease is up in May, I plan to move to a cheaper apartment or sure! $116 metrocard, $50 phone, $50 groceries, $10 spotify, about $80 utilities.

Once this part of your long-term retirement plan is fully funded (with no additional out of pocket expense really) then you can move on to working your rental empire. \n\nAre you confident that you have a sufficient cash reserve for urgent repairs or flakey tenants? I recommend that you have a 6 month reserve set aside for rental-emergencies before you plow more money into the mortgage.

Monthly expenses are <2k per month.  Been discussing the idea of more rental properties, paying down mortgage on our primary residence (~135k remaining), buying precious medals, etc.  Have done no 401k investing, but we have an extremely low risk tolerance.  Also already have our emergency fund plus some.....more cash on hand does little to no good.\n\nR/PF what's your thoughts?", "title": "Youngish engineer and accountant w/ newborn wondering about best investments", "comments": "You should still use the 401k as much as you can afford. For one, your employers likely have matching funds that you only get by contributing. That is part of your salary that you are giving away if you aren't taking it. Two, it is a huge tax benefit to contribute to your 401k, especially at your income. You may be deferring up to 30% tax by using it. That's a huge hurdle to overcome right out of the gate if you try to use after-tax dollars to find another investment. That's the opposite of low-risk, IMO. \n\nLastly, there should be a wide variety of options within your 401k plans for investments. Many of these will be very low risk, including bonds and real estate (well, real estate funds are not low risk), and as a whole, there is no other place one can invest that is entirely without risk. Investment markets are volatile over short terms, but over long time spans of a decade or longer they are possibly the best option anyone has at preserving buying power. > buying precious metals\n\n> we have an extremely low risk tolerance\n\nThose two things don't go together.  Precious metals are very volatile and don't have a good long term track record.  You can hedge some against recessions by investing in precious metals, but it's really not worth the risk.\n\n401k investing isn't that risky since you're essentially betting on the economy of the US.  If the economy of the US collapses, then none of our money is worth anything anyways.  The real keys are to invest diversely, leave your money alone, and don't invest in funds that have high expense ratios.\n\nThe typical investment route that's recommended around here is as follows:\n\n* Fund your 401k until you achieve all of your employer's match\n\n* Fully fund your personal Roth IRA.  This can be set up with a company like Vanguard where you should buy their total stock market fund or other well diversified fund.  See the wiki for details.\n\n* Fund your 401k up to the $18k/yr limit\n\n* Use a taxable account with a company like Vanguard to invest in the same way you do for your Roth or invest in real estate or in a business you own. I do my company 401K to their match, then I do my own Roth IRA to the match of $5,500 in invest the Vanguard Mutual Funds.\n\nNever only do 401K, the money is locked up till your 59 1/2. As others of said, max out your 401K contribution as close to the max ($18000 for you and $18000 for your wife) as you can get.  It's free money b/c your federal and state taxes will be reduced.   Also, if you can be aggressive, you can put another $5500 into an IRA.   If you are risk averse, choose bond based funds in the 401K and/or IRA they will have smalle, but always positive returns.  Your account balances will not decrease like they could with stock based funds.

They want to charge me $35 to auto-fill my form with data that's *already in their database*. When I said no, they **showed those benefits disappearing**. They literally coded, into the app, my data appearing on the screen and then fading away.\n\nIt does not cost $35 to have a couple lines of code automatically fill a form with data you already have, and writing that code is not an expensive endeavor that justifies a high per-customer cost, either.\n\nThanks in advance!", "title": "Should I file my taxes separately from my wife?

Whether you file single or joint does not appear in your credit report and I have never seen a credit application that asked about it.\n\nSince the credit ended in 2010, there is no credit you can get twice.  And even back then, there were safeguards against claiming it twice.\n\n>Are we filing separately for no reason?\n\nApparently so,\n\n  I don't know much about taxes but I'm pretty sure you're misunderstanding how it works Nothing you said makes sense.\n\n\nYou are required to file married.  You can choose to file joint or separate.  Joint is almost always better.  You are welcome to run the numbers both ways to figure out which gives you a lower tax bill.   >It does not cost $35 to have a couple lines of code automatically fill a form with data you already have, and writing that code is not an expensive endeavor that justifies a high per-customer cost, either.\n\nThey already have the data because they invested in building the system that initially pulled it in. The customer cost is how they get a return on that investment and profit. They could have spent months/years getting the right permissions and building up the system to connect to the IRS and other entities to gather the data, the actual cost to make a single query is probably negligible.\n\nNobody's making you use TurboTax. You should have your taxes prepared for you. \n\nYou have some serious misunderstandings that could get you in hot water. \n\nMost tax prep places will prep your taxes joint and separate to determine the best way to file. Seconding that none of this makes any sense. There are a lot of disadvantages to filing 'married filing separately' but I am not sure any are applicable to you. Or that there is a single advantage to you doing so. What is even the driving idea that is making you want to do this? The first time homebuyer credit program is expired. Unless you state is running a local one, there is no credit to be had. Also, regardless of whether the house is in just your name or just your wife's name, it's not likely you could \"scam\" the system as a second first time home buyer by switching it up the second time around. Don't try that. It's probably illegal. \n\nHere's the thing about married filing separate. You have two options: to itemize deductions or take the standard deduction. The trick is that whatever one of you does, the other must also do. So if you itemize (which you will have to do to get to take off any interest or taxes for the house), then your wife must also itemize. But if she doesn't have enough deductions to make up the difference to the standard deductions then guess who now owes a bunch more than normal in taxes? She does. And the bigger refund you get because of the house will likely go towards paying that off. The second option for separate is to both file with the standard deduction but then you don't get to take anything off for the house. \n\nIf you file Joint, you still get to itemize and take the house deductions. Depending on how much you can take off and how much you both earn, the standard deduction still might be more. I own a home and can deduct my interest and property taxes but it still doesn't beat the 12,600 standard deduction that I get for filing joint.  why I never use turbo tax....been using taxact for 17 years...which has an automatic feature to compare joint vs separate. In most cases, its always beneficial to file jointly and it has nothing to do with \"building up credit\" what so ever.

Since that time I rode the wave of the housing crisis and now my home is worth approximately $230,000.  I was recently advised that I may be receiving a transfer outside of the state this May, and as a result I have began considering what to do with my home.  As of this posting I currently owe $77,111.49 on my mortgage and I have approximately 7 years left on my financing terms at a 2.625% interest rate.  I spoke with a realtor and she advised that I could probably rent my home out for $1,700 per month.  So my question is two prong really.  First, I have enough in my savings to pay my home off prior to leaving.  I would like to purchase a home in the new city I get transferred to, and the thought of carrying two mortgages scares me.  However, if I do pay my current house off it will take a large portion of my savings.  If I do decide to keep my home would it be wise just to pay the mortgage off or should I just sustain the mortgage and use the rental payments to pay the home off?  I ran the numbers and $1,700 per month in rental income would give me approximately $20,400 per year.  At that rate I could recover my savings payoff amount in about 3.75 years.  Which in the grand scheme of things is not that long and would also allow me to save several thousand dollars in interest from the life of the mortgage.  I know there are tax benefits to having interest in a rental property but at this point I'm not paying much interest on the home.  To give you an idea in 2016 I paid $2,200.92.  I know I also have to factor in repairs, damage, etc.  \n\nSecondly, I have spoken to several landlords and the general consensus on renting seems to be TENANTS, TENANTS, and TENANTS.  My question for my fellow redditors who have experience with being a landlord is what would you have done differently knowing what you know now?  Should I obtain insurance for my appliances?  Should I use a realtor to obtain the best tenants possible?  Is there some specific language you wished you would have added to the last agreement?

We were surprised when she told my wife to be expecting a large inheritance. My mother-in-law's sister will be the executor of the estate, but we were just given a copy of the estate's EIN paperwork for our records. MiL has taken a very determined stance on getting her affairs in order, but my wife tries not to have conversations about it with her. She has told us to get a financial advisor to manage the funds, but I'm not sure how that will work since the inheritance payout will be over a number of years. We have debt; cars and credit is approximately $40k, and a mortgage of about $285k. From what my wife has told me, the inheritance will be paid out as a low 5-figure sum for the first 5 years, then the remainder will become available. My wife has lately been dealing with her sadness by overspending. The reason I came here is to ask, what do we need to do, or can we do to help, as non-executor beneficiaries?

Sometimes this is a family member or friend, other times it's a lawyer or financial advisor who is paid to administer the trust.\n\nAs executor, your MIL's sister will deal with the disposal of her estate.  Note that anything that is inside the trust *is not part of the estate* and is managed independently of the probate process.  This is a good thing, because the probate process can take many months or years, whereas money in trust can be disbursed immediately upon death (depending on the instructions for the trust).\n\nFinally, it's also worth checking out if MIL has life insurance, and who the beneficiary is.  It could be that the life insurance is designed to pay out into the trust.  In any case, life insurance also sits outside of the 'estate' for probate purposes.\n\nSorry for your situation.

The important questions to ask are:\n\n- What are you getting?\n- When are you getting it?\n- Who's giving it to you?\n\nThe first two questions sound like they're already answered. I'm a little confused by the setup here; your SIL is the executor, but there's someone out there (a lawyer? your SIL?) who's holding some money in trust? That sounds awkward to me and I would make sure I understood it thoroughly. Your MIL's lawyer can probably answer these questions.\n\nStill, since you know what you're owed, I'd advise waiting to get your own lawyer unless something fishy came up. Is the SIL trustworthy? Does your MIL say why she's doing the payout thing? Is she worried about _your_ wife, maybe because of past overspending? Wild guess, obviously.\n\nSo I think you just need to answer the questions about who's doing what. The next phase is getting an advisor who can tell you what to do with the money, and there's advice for finding one on this subreddit, even if most of us would tell you to DIY. I think a 3rd party would come in handy; if you don't trust your wife's spending habits, having a mutually-agreed-upon plan for the incoming money could help ward that off.\n\nOh, and get your wife to a therapist or support group.

I would like some input and advice on my life/finance to get me on track and in the right direction. Terribly sorry if I format wrong or did not include everything, but I am a long time lurker on this sub. \n\nI am a twenty year old female that has currently 5k in just credit card debt, and a few goals that I want to achieve very soon.

My parents were never good either however they aren't to blame for my reckless spending. \n\nNow that I am older, I am starting to regret alllll of the money mistakes I have been making in the past and I don't want to be like that anymore. I have a minimum wage job working at a coffee shop (7.25 an hour) working five days out of the whole week. So in all 29 hours, six hours on weekdays and five on weekends. Sometimes I'll get 36 hours if someone calls out or if he (the boss) wants me to stay an hour later. However I do make about 30 dollars on average in tip money whenever I work more or less. Some days are more than 30 dollars and some days less than 30 dollars. I had another job but work is slow due to the winter season and so quit.

Stop using Uber, either figure out a bike or public transit, or get a job that you can walk to/from.  Given that your boyfriend works in the same building, you might even consider looking for an apartment closer to work to save money for both of you.  \n  \nYou need to come up with a system for tracking your income and spending that you don't lose so easily.  If pen/paper work, that's great, but take a picture at least every day with your phone, or enter it into a Google Spreadsheet on a regular basis.  \n  \nYou primarily have an income problem, and you know how to solve it - better pay and more hours. Step One: Consolidate all your credit card debt onto the card with the lowest APR.\nStep Two: Spend more money at the grocery store and less at restaurants.   This may take some cooking skill, since cooking from scratch is usually cheaper than Frozen Dinners, but even those are cheaper than restaurants.\nStep Three: Get a bike and learn to ride it.   Since you mentioned biking as an option, I assume that the path between your workplace and home is a reasonable distance and bike safe.   Bikes can usually be found cheaply at thrift stores, yard sales, and flea markets.\nStep Four: Avoid getting a car unless it is financially advantageous.   Cars are a huge expense and you are getting by without one currently.   Hold off on getting the car until all your debt is paid off or having the car would allow you to make enough more money to at least cover the expense of the car. Good news, you are on the right track by starting a budget. Never to late to learn. It is good that you started keeping reciepts and tried to start tracking your finances. Assuming you have a smartphone, I recommend using any number of financial apps to get you in the habit of recording spending habits; I used Cash Droid on mine for the longest time. Every time they hand you a receipt, enter it into your phone. The program is in the Google Play store and is still free. Learning to budget is just like any skill, takes time and practice.\n\nRemember, money is a tool. Never stress over money, either you have it or you don't. Be more concerned over impulse buys and try to disquisition between wants and needs. Such as I want a new [insert item] verses I need to buy groceries.\n\nWork - A job is a job is a job. 3 hours a week is better than no hours a week. If the cost of going to the job outweigh the money coming in, then you were right to quit. But if you make more at the restaurant and can pick up more hours then that was a smart move. Unless the boss is paying attention to labor costs, offer to work for others. They may schedule you 27 hours but you can pick up other shifts for other people. This is how I turned a 25 scheduled work week into 38.\n\nTips - I was a pizza driver for 18 years; never rely on your tips to pay bills. Tips are gravy. I also understand that being a server you might have reduced pay. If so, instead of getting a second job just find a new one. Pizza is fun but it takes a special person to be able to be able to handle the stress.\n\nCredit cards - These can be tricky but let's simplify this a moment. APR is the mount of money you spend to be able to use credit. This is how the companies make money. I recommend you start paying down the one with the highest interest as quickly as possible. Making minimum payments only touches the interest you're paying and does nothing towards what the principle balance (what you bought). So lets add 5-10 bucks to Discover and AMEX payments and if we can double the Capital One payment or at least add as much as you can comfortably. If you can, stop using these for awhile to the balances down. If you're looking to build credit, keep your balances between 20-25% of the total.\n\nRent and Utilities - Unfortunately, these are static payments and will never change. Your BF is awesome for being so nice to reduce your rent to get your finances under control. I have faith that you will make good on getting a budget. Otherwise, I see little reason for such a long post asking for advice.\n\nUber - Walk, wait, or call a friend. Use your own judgement about the walking part and be safe. If you're waiting, best time to do some studying without to much distraction. Nothing wrong riding an adult trike instead of a two wheeled bike.\n\nLuxury Items - Try and think of some of the habits you spend on. Soda, vending machines, cigarettes, alcohol, etc. Are you paying for cable tv? If you're planning on getting a second job, I'd seriously consider cutting the cord on tv. A carton of cigarettes is about half the cost of a step 1 patch at Walmart; I've used these to quit for awhile so I could save money and then picked the habit back up. I enjoy smoking, I know what the effects are, and we can swap medical pictures later like I do when I talk to my doctor.\n\nEating out vs. Cooking - I understand being on the go and eating out instead of cooking. I will be the first to admit juggling driving, calling a customer to find a house, and eating a burger all at once. Being in the food industry was a blessing at times. Crockpots are a great investment; learn to cook big meals in one day and freeze them for later in the week. You can set a crockpot on low in the morning and come home to a nice meal. If the food where you work isn't free or reduced start bringing snacks from home.\n\nI have not been on reddit in awhile so I may not get your response for awhile, who knows I might check in an hour or two to see what you think. Lastly, I only responded because you wrote so much. You can do this and best of luck to you! Cheers!  \n\n>Uber $100 or less (I would bike but I don't know how to ride a bike lol so sad right?)

Once you pay the mortgage/tax/ins, 10% to the rental agency who manages things, set aside money for repairs, deal with empty months with no tenant, the margins are crap outside of a few towns where there's a huge price disparity between owning and renting.\n\nAs long as you aren't underwater, I'd sell unless the difference in rental prices vs all the stuff above you have to pay is worthwhile. Equity isn't guaranteed. If you've got good equity now, take it and be happy. No guarantee it won't drop 3 years from now.\n\nAs for taxes, you'll owe a bit more for employer-paid since you aren't getting the mortgage interest and property tax deductions.

It puts alot of unnecessary stress physically and mentally. What I decided to do because I really dont want to go to college is I applied to the carpenters union to become an apprentice. I have little experience but i've met people who got in with absolutely no experience and 6 months in the guy is making $18 an hour already. You get paid to learn and after 4 years you are can become a journeyman carpenter making $30-$40 an hour. Im doing a program called YouthBuild that is a Pre apprenticeship program that is teaching me the basics and im getting paid to learn as well. Think about it. Im not sure if you said youre male or female but if youre female it is a gaurantee you'll be getting in because they need a certain amount of women in each jobsite or they get fined/sued.  You need to find a mentor (every young adult should have one). Doesn't necessarily have to be a family member (mine wasn't). Could be a family friend, a neighbor, hell even your boss if he's cool. Do you know anyone who has their shit together that you trust?\n\nSome areas have programs specifically for this sort of thing. Often found at libraries, civic centers, in some cases even things like Meetup groups. If anything is better than living with your folks, you can poke around shared housing. If you're with college students it should be okay, and maybe even pleasant. I'm doing this currently for 450$ a month, and that includes everything (heat, electricity, internet). However, be careful, I have had one crazy guy, who wasn't dangerous, just literally insane. \n\nOtherwise, get enrolled in college. Go into a field that's lucrative or that you're sure you want to pursue, and you could live in dorm or on campus, living off a combination of part time work and student loans. My heart goes out to you. I am diagnosed bipolar with psychotic features and I had a very unhealthy home environment with my mother. I am now 24 (f) and married and I do not face the same struggles that I used to have. I worked at Wal-Mart from ages 16-23 and made 10.40/hr before I was fired from there in June 2015 for having a psychotic break at work. During those years, I stayed at many places. I will tell you now: you cannot afford your own apartment. Rent a room. Try and find students or perhaps an older woman to live with if you are female. I would pursue a career in college, and take out student loans to help you get by. But do not pursue a career that has a shit job market. Try something medical.  (But maybe not: I chose not to do medical because of my mental health condition, you might be similar. Didn't want to go cookoo and give somebody the wrong meds.) If you are fairly intelligent, the computer field is a great place to turn to. My husband is self-taught with no college education and makes 117,000 a year. But he's the exception, not the rule. You could go to school for computers. An education is generally needed. Think STEM fields. Since it seems like you are feeling uneasy/insecure about your lack of knowledge in this area, is suggest taking this whole process slowly so you don't become overwhelmed. I know you want to be able to move out as soon as you can, but taking on a lot of responsibilities you're unaccustomed to at once could be overwhelming and might cause you to fail simply because it was too much in a short time period. Set some smaller short term goals to start building the skills you want so you will be better prepared when you do move out. \n\nI'm not an expert in any of this, but here is what I would recommend doing. First determine what you might want to do career wise in the coming years. Is your current job the sort of thing you'd be happy doing long term with possibilities for advancement so you can live off it? If not, what else might you want to do and what steps are necessary to get there? This will likely involve more research. Do you want to pursue a college degree or learn a trade? Would you want to live in the same area or move to a different one? How might your health issues impact your ability to pursue whichever possibilities you're considering? \n\nYou don't have to know these answers immediately. And once you choose something that doesn't mean you're locked into it forever. It seems like what's most important to you at the moment is feeling like you're secure wherever you are. Maybe if your job is something like retail or service for a larger company or chain, you could request a transfer to another store in an area that has more resources for you once you've been there a while and built up a reputation as a hard worker. This will impact where you might want to look for a place to live and your timeline. \n\nWhile you consider what options you might want for the future, start building a better understanding of what you'll need to accomplish these things. I'd start but figuring out your budget. Track how much you actually bring in after taxes on average and how much you are currently spending and what you're spending it on. There are a lot of good websites and services to help you learn to budget. If you aren't currently paying for things like your food or medications yourself figure out what those might cost. Track what you're eating and guess what those things cost to buy from week to week. \n\nStart establishing credit, either with a phone contract as another poster recommended or something like a secured credit card with a regular charge on it like a Netflix subscription or paying for the phone each month. Other than the small reoccurring charge don't use the card and be sure to pay it off in full each month. Set calendar reminders to make sure it gets paid. Don't accrue any debt or interest on it. It's just a tool to build yourself a good credit rating. \n\nIf you don't have a bank account get one after researching what the banks in your area offer. Go into the bank branches and ask questions about their account options before committing to anything. Once you have an account, get into the habit of checking it regularly to be sure you know where it's at and that you recognize where all the deposits and withdrawals are coming from. Start saving as much as you can now while you learn your finances so that you can have the funds you need in case you have to pay multiple months rent up front once you do move out. Many apartments require you to pay a security deposit when you move in, often along with payments for the first and last month of your lease before you move in. You will likely also need to purchase items for yourself when first moving out on your own. Plates, utensils, cookware, towels, cleaning supplies, furnishing. Consider what you might be able to take with you from your parents house and what you might need to get for yourself.  Factor those and moving costs into your plans as you save up ahead of time. \n\nDo plenty of research and if you get stuck on something you can always ask Reddit more specific questions which might be easier for people to answer than one very large question like this one. \n\nBest of luck! Sounds like you need some new experience.  Go join the military. Find what you can do for the rest of the life.\n Far from having my shit together, either. Also, bipolar. I can tell you one thing. Go to therapy and stay there. Until you aren't learning anything or getting anything from it. If you have to, go to a free clinic.\n\nYou've got to learn to cope with things before you get to some semblance of normal. Also, you've got to learn to trust people. Not everyone, but you're going to need one or two. Don't waste your time on people who you don't get support from.\n\nWith money, get a roommate while you're young. Live with three or four people if you have to. Always keep an eye open for something a little better. A job that pays a little more, a cheaper living space, whatever you can do. Live well below your means. \n\nIf you need advice or someone to talk to. I'm here. have you read the sidebar/faq It sounds like you shouldn't move out. Obviously you have to weigh that with what you're dealing with, but trying to move out at 18/feeling like you need to is not a good thing. You are not behind, you're doing fine, you don't have to leap four steps forward all at once. Get to a job with some upward mobility and work hard and study in your downtime. I'm seeing skilled trade suggestions, that kind of thing. Some jobs with relatively short certification processes I can think of (some you can work while you learn) are realtor, vet tech, nursing assistant, electrician, plumber. Give yourself a couple YEARS to move out. If you are busy and you have a plan it will be easier to deal with your parents. (Obviously if your dealing with an abusive home, completely ignore me). But if you decide to stay home and work on earning more remember to be grateful for your parents. You are not behind. You're doing fine. Everyone feels this way. EVERYONE. The anxiety is there to help move you forward, use it.  Your salary is too low to live on your own outside of the ghetto, and if you're having a breakdown thinking about paying bills and shit then you should also hang out for another few months at least and build savings / find good roommates -- from a financial perspective.\n\nThe steps to do adult things are mostly simple. To find a place to rent, go to the big building at the front of the apartment complex you're interested in and ask the guy or gal employed there about it. To pay bills, call and pay with your debit card. To find roommates and stuff, contact your friends. For taxes, download that free software on the internet.\n\nHowever, again, I'd advise you to set a date, wait and be patient for a little bit to save up. Walk out the door dignified and ready, don't sprint out the door without food money. 1. Save about 1000-2000.\n\n2. There is probably some us version of spareroom.co.uk. Use that or a similar site to find housing.\n\nI think you need about 300+/week to survive. Try to bump up hours (or skills) to get that. Your wage is good enough that if you were working full time you can survive. Dont take up expensive habits like smoking, drinking or drugs. Drinking or drugs tend to distort your perspective and may lead you into making even worse choices. Also, stay away from organised religion. Thats also quite expensive. Have you looked into the military? My parents sheltered me and didn't push me academically. I realized I had no plan at 17 and that college was not somewhere I wanted to go, I saw it as more high school bull shit.\n\nI did 4 years in the army. They were all tough but in the end I had traveled, learned a lot, and am better for it. \n\nAfter, college was a breeze (electrical engineering, high GPA) and I've always found good work without looking. Veterans preference is a real thing. \n\nI would advise the Navy or Coast Guard. The current state of the world makes the other services strained.\n\nIf you join, Just pick a job, don't even think about where they send you. If you try to control your career too much the military sucks. Just go with it, but make sure you pick a job with transferrable skills. Metal work, IT, military police,  and anything avionics related are great. \n\nTry to avoid combat systems or operational jobs. They don't transfer anything so unless u do 20 years you basically are marking time until you get out and go to school. \n\n One thing I haven't directly seen mentioned here yet is that you want to make sure you're job is stable. You said somewhere that you've only received one paycheck so far, so you might not know if it's going to last. You don't want to get into a place only to be fired and realize you can't pay rent.\n\nBuilding up an emergency fund for a few months of expenses could be a good start to be prepared for if that does happen, as well as time to make sure the job is stable and you want to keep working there Join the army and get 3 meals a day plus a place to sleep.\nAlso, you will learn good job skills that will pay more than $9 per hour. I would seriously recommend getting a good book, it will take you through things step by step and be slower for you! Will be worth your time and money! \"I will teach you to be Rich\" by Ramit Sethi, (more engaging and an easier read) or Personal Finance for Dummies (will cover more ground, like renting apartments and insurance) both are good, get to amazon and buy one!  I dont have any really great advice, other than you just gotta start to shop around; however, I DO want to emphasize: make sure you take the time to READ and UNDERSTAND any contract that you sign. I had to educate myself on everything available to me.  Knowledge really is power and learn as much as you can while saving up as much as you can. Living paycheck to paycheck can be kinda scary.\nSit and run numbers over and over too.  Like, if I get an apartment for x amount, and figure there will be x amount for utilities, and how much for gas and car insurance or whatever mode of transportation you use... along with how much you work and if you want holidays or sick days, and how do you afford if something extra happens...   \n\nLearn where you can get breaks from, if at all.  How much do you need as a downpayment for a place. Don't ever plan on getting your deposit back, just take it as a happy surprise when you do. \n\nAnd yes, like someone mentioned, find a mentor. Someone you can have help guide and encourage you even if they don't know all the answers. \n\nEdit was for having my iPad fall and send comment too early.  You're already way ahead of the curve by reaching out like this, the information is out there it won't happen over night what's important is developing a continuous habit of studying up and poking around to figure out your situation, it won't be easy but what you'll learn will be invaluable to you in the future. So you've already got the right idea, poke around this sub and others, but in the end it is important for you to learn this lesson on your own(obviously not completely on your own we're all here to gladly assist) you'll be much more prepared and feel great having control it'll take a little failure but that's ultimately the greatest way to really learn. I felt like that once upon a time...get a job that in the service industry...work for tips...get good...move to a job with more expensive food...it's a first step..but crucial when you don't have a degree and can't find a job that pays 15 an hour plus You can find everything you need through internet searches.  A budget, and a plan can easily be found and understood relatively quickly.  Executing it is on you.  You're doing the right thing by trying to come up with a plan. This (reddit) is a great resource but not local to you. You can hit up your state's social service division in charge of employment. Illinoisjobworks.com or whatever.\n\nDon't overlook trade skills like welding, electrician, plumber, some of those guys make six figures a year with little education or up front money. Make a LinkedIn- great resource for connecting with professionals  $9/hr won't get you any decent place to live unless you have several room mates. I don't know if Illinois is one of those dirt cheap mid western places Reddit loves to drone on about, but even if that were the case, you're looking at MAX 1K a month which isn't much. But if you CAN live on 9/hr there, then fuck it, Illinois HERE I COME!\n\nAnother issue is the range in pay, 300-500 biweekly. That tells me that you're not getting steady consistent hours, but rather they change on a weekly basis? You can't budget if you don't have a damn good idea of how much you're gonna be taking home, and even if you're conservative and go with the lesser amount, you're worse off with only 600/month to work with.\n\nThose are the issues I see, but as far as answers:\n\n1) Convince your boss to give you a guaranteed amount of hours, preferably 40\n\n2) Get a second job or a better paying job to supplement your income\n\n3) Ask independent people you know how much they pay in rent, utilities, groceries etc so you have an idea of how much it costs to live in your area. Then check Craigslist for room listings\n\n4) Create a budget by subtracting that estimate from your monthly income and see how much is left over, adjust where necessary and increase your income if necessary\n\nUntil you get at least some of that done, you'll be making a HUGE mistake leaving your parents place. It's rough out here man. I had to start over with a limited income. I suggest you rent a room, preferably with an older person who could use some young muscle. You can barter work for some of the rent. You won't have the responsibility of a lease, which is way too much of a burden for your age, income and anxiety level. You have to crawl before you walk. Take it slow. Best wishes. neither does any other 19 year old- but at least you know that and are primed to start learning. It wont take much daily effort to outshine those that surround you and it will pay off in the long run. I cant tell you what you need to learn, I can promise that you will benefit in every way imaginable by drinking less and  smoking less pot- you wont meet many older people who wish they did more partying. Most of us continued long after it was memorable. You can spend a thousand nights in bars and only a handful become worthwhile memories. You don't pay rent? Your money is your own? Think about getting a better job and learn about personal finance - read some basic books. \n\nYou'll realize that not paying rent (probably not paying for your meals while you are at home) is a great advantage. \n\nYour home life may not be that good - but at some point, you may be living with roommates and your life with them may not be all that good. Pick your 'not good' and weigh in the 'Not paying rent and someone else is feeding me' factor.\n\nAsk if you can cook meals once in a while - and learn to cook. Go to the library and get a book about it if you don't already have basic cookbooks at home. This skill will serve you well all your life. \n\nGo to the grocery store and walk through with a budget of, say, $25 for a week and plan how you would be able to feed just yourself with $25 for 21 meals. Imagine taking $12 of those dollars and spending it on a meal out in an inexpensive restaurant (think diner) - now plan 20 meals for the week on $13. \n\nYou have to start somewhere. Start with the basics. Read about insurance. Realize that you need health insurance. If you are covered by your parent's health insurance, give them a 'thank you' for that. But put it in your imaginary budget and realize that health insurance will not cover everything and you will have to pay out of pocket - and try to figure out what those things are.\n\nThese are things that everyone learns in fits and starts - and often, the hard way. It's not easy to lay out in simple directives but there's a lot open to discussion (hence, 'Personal Finance' on reddit). \n\nLearn how to do housework. Unless you plan to hook up with someone in the future who's going to be your personal maid, you'll need to know how to clean out the tub and toilet, wash dishes, etc. Life skills that will serve you all your life.\n This thread has some great advice already, namely the sentiment that your wage is way too little to survive on if you move out. I'm not sure which metropolis you are in but according to MIT, the minimum livable wage in Chicago is about $12 an hour. That's $3 an hour more that you need, and keep in mind that this would be *bare bones* living. No eating out, no fun money, just working to live. Others in this thread have said college, but also consider trade school if college isn't for you.  Check out /r/internetparents. They can help discuss a plan of action and help give you direction when you don't have anyone else to go to. :) Let me tell ya something, I am in my 30ies and am always thinking about my future.  Just when you think you have a handle on life, life throws you a curve ball.  I thought I had everything.  A couple months ago my dad died. If it wasn't for these wonderful people in PF I would be lost.  What I learned is that its super tough starting out but save what you can as often as you can.  It helps so much.  You might not think 5 bucks here 10 bucks there is much but adds up quick.  Another thing to remember is you don't have to impress anybody. I have met and worked with millionaires and you would never believe they were wealthy by how they dress or the car they drive.  People say \"money comes and goes so you might as well enjoy it now.\"  In my opinion, that's not true. Those people who say that have no net worth.  They are the ones that will have to work until they are dead.  You want to be able to enjoy life after retirement. Not die working only to say \"I should have saved when I was younger.\"  Just keep your head up.  Even snail progress is still progressively moving you foward.  You don't become wealthy or just happy by giving your money away.  Sorry for the rant I had a few drinks tonight and just wanted to write.  Good luck! https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/index I dont know if I am too late for this but...\n\n\nFrom what I have gathered from your responses and other responses here I can relate to your situation in a certain way. I can't find a FT position and I am not in school. Currently I am seeking apprenticeships/ stepping stone jobs to make a career out of. It isn't fun nor as easy as people make it. Its a lot of resum\u00e9 printing and constant application forms.\n\nMy additional advice to you to go along with everyone else's would be to find at least another job to work as well or find a better one at least. In my area (MN) jobs starting between 11-12 an hour are not uncommon and require minimal skill. That extra 2-3 an hour will be very helpful while you seek additional employment. I work 3 jobs right now and while it isn't fun, I know for the time being it isn't in vain. Minimum wage just won't cut it for you, even if you are living at home with low expenses. You need to get some savings together and a portfolio. If you can get a resum\u00e9 put together that will help, even if it isn't deep.  I'm literally in your shoes right now.19 never had a plan or been outside my home state, I'm enrolled and taking college classes poorly.

In 2016, I lived in NJ all year, but I earned substantially all my income a single job (W-2 income) in NYC. (I also earned a small amount in interest from a non-NY savings account that was allocated to NJ, but don't think that should impact things much). My understanding was always that the NY state tax, which is higher than NJ state tax, typically entirely offsets the NJ tax of those who work and earn all income in NY but who live in NJ.\n\nOn my W-2, the NY state income in box 16 (which is the same as my W-2 federal income) is about $5,000 lower than the NJ state income in box 16 of the NJ section of the W-2. My understanding is that this is because NY excludes more items from W-2 income than NJ. \n\nBased on HR Block, my total NY state tax liability ended up being about $10,300 (and I got a slight refund due to excess withholding). My total NJ state tax liability (before the credit for NY state tax) ended up being about $8,500. My NJ tax credit for my NY state tax paid, according to HR Block, is only about $8,250, so, since nothing was withheld, I ended up owing a bit less than $250 to NJ. \n\nMy question is - does this make sense? What happened was, since NY and NJ count income differently, and the NJ income was $5000 \"higher\" (even though it's based on the same \"actual\" income, I included the lower NY income in the comparative calculation on the NJ return since it asked for \"income properly taxed\" by both jurisdictions), the \"maximum allowable credit percentage\" on my NJ tax return was about 97% of my total NJ tax liability, which meant I would end up owing the last 3%. \n\nFor people in similar situations, does this sound right to you, or should I have included the same number in the \"properly taxed by both jurisdictions\" field as was included on the NJ W-2, so that 100% (or 99.9%, once I add in the NJ interest) of the NY state tax liability would be credited against NJ state tax?\n\nThanks in advance!", "title": "NY/NJ State Tax Credit Question", "comments": "It sounds about right. It's not surprising that you would owe a small amount of NJ tax. Honestly the most surprising thing to me is that you have both states on your W-2. It sounds about right.  I live in NJ, work in NY.

Breakdown of our accounts is:\n\nAll Vanguard\n     -  Both have 401k's we contribute to\n     -  Both have Roth IRAs we actively contribute to\n     -  Both have Traditional IRAs that we do not contribute to (rollovers from previous 401ks)\n\nI've done some limited reading on backdoor Roth contributions but since we don't actively contribute to our traditional, is it worth doing this?

You'll also need to file Form 8606 this year to inform the IRS that you made non-deductible Traditional IRA contributions, so that if you convert later the IRS won't think you owe income tax on the converted amount.\n\nLong term, you won't be able to convert the money back to Roth without either rolling your other Traditional IRA money back into a 401(k) plan, or by performing a standard Traditional to Roth conversion and paying taxes *pro-rata*, i.e. based on how much of your Traditional IRA was deductible versus non-deductible. How much do you currently have in your traditional IRAs? I've been through this and it's not too hard to fix. \n\nCall your Roth fund custodian and tell them you need to reverse excess contributions to your Roth. Tell them you need to remove $2000 plus an extra hundred or so. They will remove the amount specified plus earnings on the amount according to the IRS guidelines. \n\nThe reason I say add an extra hundred is that if you're in the phase out income range, the extra income associated with the growth of your excess contributions will reduce your contribution allowance further than your tax software is currently calculating. Pulling out a bit extra helps ensure your under the cap even with the extra income. \n\nThe tricky part is that the growth won't be on any of your 2016 tax documents.

None of the debts refereed too in this post are owed by me, they are owed too my mother. I live with my mom and my older sister. We all work. \n\nHere is a quick summary of the situation. We owe a huge amount each month in loans (personal loans from payday kinda places). Its smothering us. On top of that we got a 60 day notice a few weeks back and need to move by march 6th. We planned on waiting until we get our tax return, we expect them around the 15th of feb, and then moving. We need to stay afloat till then. Our car-payment, $413, is due by the end of the month and our rent is due on the 5th. We are trying to find another personal loan right now to get us through till we can move, but I dont want to do that. The loans are killing us. Its the reason we are in this situation. We need to find a way to pay our car payment and be able to make rent. I dont know if anyone on this sub will be able to give any advice, but I dont know where to turn. I feel like im writing this out just because I want to affirm im not crazy, haha. \n\nI know im an adult, but im only 19 and sometimes the stress gets too much, you know? Its crushing. I cant stop thinking about it. I feel like I cannot breath. I haven't eaten much and cant sleep. I feel like im dying from stress. ", "title": "In a very bad situation. Dont know where to turn. Feel like am drowning.", "comments": "$413 seems like a huge amount on a car payment,.. can you do anything about that?\n\nCan you list out a full list of expenses and income?\n\nIt sounds like you guys have been used to spending beyond your means (hence the payday loans). You need to get your expenses below your income whatever it takes. [deleted] If you delayed payment of next month's rent, and spent it on the loans instead, how much would that reduce the principal? Without seeing a full budget, it will be pretty hard to give any concrete advice.\n\nWorking with what is given, the first thing is that you have an exorbitantly high car payment. How much is owed on it, what is the interest rate, and what is the car worth today if you were to sell it?\n\nAnd yes, you need to get out from under those payday loans. What sort of credit score does your mom have? Has she applied for a personal loan from a bank or credit union?\n\nAs for moving, check that 60 day notice is sufficient - if you live in places with rent control or other strict ordinances, your landlord may be forced to give you more time and/or money to leave. The three of you work but your combined income averages $12,800 per person. A full-time minimum wage job pays about $20,000. Are you all working as hard as you could be? $3,200 a month for three people is nothing. \n\nIf your mom and sister are already contributing as much as they can, you need to start doing the same. Get a full time job somewhere and put in overtime, you're 19 so there's no excuses. \n\nIf you want to continue going to College, do 2 or 3 courses online at a Community College and get Financial Aid. Stop smoking weed too, that's food money right there.  I don't quite understand your situation but I do know that my car financing company had a deal where you could skip a month -- once -- and it was tacked on at the end. Maybe call them?\n\nI never used it and assume you'll end up paying a teeny more in interest eventually, but you'd get through the month.\n\n It is great that steps are being taken to reduce rent, I think it is just a matter of getting stable, taking a breath and reducing costs in each item where possible. \n\nFor the phone 200 for 3 is a bit high, even unlimited plans at an MVNO like straight talk are available at $40-50 per person. Comcast doesn't seem too bad given that it's comcast, you might want to push for going internet-only and watching OTA to save some cash, might not amount to much though.\n\nCar insurance and the actual payment is a matter of shopping around, having a reliable but older car might help so long as it isn't a super high theft target insurance wise. Less in your control at 19 it sounds like but you can help ensure that they don't get screwed on financing on a car. If financing is necessary I always say do it separately at a credit union or bank and then go shopping for a car once they send you the loan check. You might be able to fiddle with insurance coverage though, it is easy to get a quote with geico or others and play around with options. Best of luck. First of all, negotiate your monthly expenses. You can't afford your phone's & Comcast as they are right now. Strip them to the bare bones. Figure out what you need to do to slash both of those by half and do it immediately. If you have to restrict yourselves to local calling only, do it. If you're on contract, talk to your provider's loyalty department and explain the situation. They usually have minimums you have to keep up on contract, but you can occasionally figure out workarounds for them. And for Comcast, switch over to the cheapest package they have.\n\nFood is a huge expense. Slash your food budget as much as possible. Get stuff from friends and the food bank. Take that money and apply it to your loans. Pay above the minimum on the loan that will be the quickest to get rid of. Then apply what you paid to that loan to the other two.\n\nFigure out a way to bring in more money. I don't know if you have a job but get one if you don't. If you're on welfare, take cash jobs. Don't spend any of it. Put it all on the loans. Pick up extra shifts at work if you do have a job.\n\nIf you're a girl, babysit. If you're a guy, search for \"paid cash\" jobs on Kijiji. Find companies that hire unskilled labourers. I hate to recommend day labour companies but you can have cash in hand and their standards are low. \n\nDo you have ANYTHING of value you can sell? Sell it.\n\nDon't go out at all. Entertain yourself at home whenever possible.\n\nIf you have skills, use them to make money.\n\nIf you have family, borrow money off them at a much lower interest rate.\n\nIs the car necessary? If not, stop driving it and cancel your insurance. Take the bus everywhere or walk. This will also save you on gas money. Try and renegotiate the car payment.  Tell the payday company your paydates have changed to once a month, they prolly know you by now to belive you. This will leave you with some extra money, also request a payment plan.

The stock was given to me as a gift, always in appx. $14k increments, once each year, so they won't have to pay taxes on the stock. The stock is going well but the problem is it's all in one company. Obviously I need to diversify but I have a few questions/concerns:\n\n1. If I sell it now, how do I know how much I would owe in taxes? I believe part of the tax rate depends on what my grandparents originally purchased it for, but they wouldn't have purchased it all at once. So I have no idea what the original stock purchase price would've been.\n\n2. I want to diversify, but I want some of it to be easily accessible. By that, I mean if I put all of it in a retirement fund I would be penalized taking it out before retirement. My wife and I might want to use some of it for a down payment on a house within the next 5 years, so putting it all into a retirement fund wouldn't be a good idea. Any way I can keep the money (at least half of it) in a fund/investment/etc. that won't penalize me to withdraw within the next 5 years for the down payment?\n\n3. Some of the stock I wouldn't mind having in the stock market for long-term (30+ years). I'm fairly conservative as an investor so this would ideally be something where I wouldn't need to be super concerned about brief recessions (I'm in the US) because I would take a long-term view of the market as a whole.\n\nEdit: They purchased and held the stock for many years before gifting it to me. It wasn't purchased and immediately gifted.\n\nThanks in advance for any advice!", "title": "~$100k in one stock gifted to me over the years, how do I diversify?", "comments": "First off, very cool grandparents!\n\nNext, you are actually talking about different things here friend:\n\n1. Any cash you want to use in the next 5 years, realistically, should not be in investments as they are more geared for long term. If you want the money to make more gains than savings, you might want to look at CDs, although they are still time sensitive the gains are guaranteed (and lower of course).\n\n2. To sell the stock, it is based on the purchase price of the shares. Whoever you have the shares with has a cost basis form that is supposed to have beenupdated whenever more shares were added. \n\nGood luck!\n\n 1) avoid mutual funds and stick to ETFs (if you're really interested I can give you three very in-depth reasons why);\n2) select a couple of ETFs that are unrelated in terms of their underlying exposure. For example, equities (i.e. Stocks) have become increasingly correlated in their returns over the last few years (meaning, they've become more and more related in terms of performance and thus you enjoy less diversification benefits). For my Roth account, I actually selected some similar ETFs that Acorns uses (https://www.acorns.com/investments) because they have some nice different cuts of exposure to various asset classes. I added a commodity exposure though as well (using another lost cost ETF). You can use up to $10,000 each from an IRA as a down payment for a house if you are both first-time home buyers. [Here](http://www.kiplinger.com/article/spending/T010-C001-S003-how-home-buyers-can-tap-an-ira-penalty-free.html) is the most recent article I can find on Google backing that up, from Kiplinger.\n\nThere are a few easy ways to diversify without getting too technical. You can focus on passively managed funds. The ETF market is huge right now and you could pick a few that don't track the same index and possibly one that is tracking an index in a different country. The other option is since you're already with Vangaurd you might want to speak to them. Don't spring for any options that allow them to charge commission (some people might but I'm to worried about churning).  So each increment was given as a annual gift? Here is a pretty good link, [stock as gift. ](http://fairmark.com/investment-taxation/capital-gain/stocks-and-other-securities/stock-received-gift/). You can open a brokerage account at Vanguard or a variety of other brokerages and invest your funds there in a taxable account. Money you plan on using in 5 years are typically held in cash, although I don't do that myself.

If you get a very low interest car loan, paying a minimal or no down payment allows you to save your money in better investments that outperform the interest loss. \n\nHowever, there is risk. If you put no money down, the car will be worth less than your loans for a while. If something happens to the car, for example someone else totals your car, the insurance payout will be less than what you owe. Unless you have the money to pay out the difference, you will have difficulty getting another car. Moreover, if you want to get rid of the car, you will have trouble doing so without paying extra money (difference between car value and loan). \n\nFurthermore, your other investments might not beat the loan APR. On average they will, but they won't necessarily do so. And if you are not disciplined in saving that extra money, you are effectively paying more interest for no real return. \n\nMy general advice here is as follows. Do you have great credit? Invest well? Buying a car that is 30% or less of your gross annual income? Budget well? Maybe you should go with a lower down payment. \n\nDo you have poor credit? Few investments? Buying a car that is more than 30% of your gross annual income? Maybe you should go with a higher down payment. \n\nThe above is not an absolute rule by any means. The bottom line is simple, but hard for some to actually do. If you will save the additional money in investments that, on average, yield 2-3% higher returns than your car loan, then a lower down payment might make financial sense.  [deleted] I would say it completely depends on the loan, how much the car cost, how much you have saved up, and your income.

I hated it and dropped out and now have 65K in student loans.  I started working in sales to pay the bills, and eventually ended up at my current job.  I don't particularly enjoy the sales environment though.\n\n\nCurrent Job:  I make 46K, have a 3% 401 K match, pretty good insurance, and 2 weeks vacation (goes to 3 weeks later this year).  I bring home about 1150 biweekly after deductions for 401k, tuition, and an automatic savings transfer.  I'm about to finish the MBA program at this school in a few months. \n\n\nI work for one of the \"better\" for-profit colleges as a recruiter of sorts.  When student enrollment is up, my job is great.  When it's down, it's pretty miserable.

However, that boss is out on maternity leave for a few months and my temporary boss is amazing.  There have also been some changes in upper management, and the person my boss was tattling to was moved to a different division.  I've recently met the new upper manager and they seem pretty awesome.\n\n\nI started looking casually around February of last year for a new job, but most of what I was being offered was in sales.  Once I finish my MBA, I'll only be a few classes short to be able to sit for my CPA.  I've found a school where I can finish these up and get my BS in Accounting for $3k.  I was able to get a $500 scholarship, but to keep it, I need to accept the scholarship within 60 days and start classes in a couple of months.\n\n\nNew job:  Internal auditor for a government agency.  I haven't received the final offer (going in Monday for that), but I'm expecting around $30,700 which is pretty terrible.  The job itself sounds like something I'd really enjoy, and I would be qualified for the 10 year loan forgiveness program, and if I didn't stick around for 10 years, I feel like the auditor job would give me something better to put on my resume for future accounting jobs.

The pay cut is substantial, but you may be paying less for insurance, you may get a pension and/or better retirement account options, more PTO, and more consistent and manageable hours.

Cheers!", "title": "Got a new job, finally out of medicaid and foodstamps, but now can't budget in insurance even with ACA.", "comments": "FYI you qualify for food assistance from pantries that receive TEFAP (federal) food.  The income qualification for a family of 4 is $57,105 (235% of poverty line).  Quality and value of pantries will vary wildly, but it is extra food. Wife gets a part time job... Your 4-year old should be starting kindergarten next year. She can also do the child-care hustle and watch other kids.\n\nYou could increase your exemptions. [Go Here to calculate](https://apps.irs.gov/app/withholdingcalculator/)\n\n [deleted] We have two kids and have been stuggling as well since my husband was laid off last February.  We both got class B licenses and became school bus drivers.  He used that to get hired with Pepsi and get trained into a Class A license so we are finally doing better.  \n\nI mention this though because as a school bus driver I am able to take the kids with me and they pretty much just sleep on the bus or watch youtube on my phone. I make 18 bucks an hour and get about 35 hours a week.  We have a nice midday break where I can get errands and doctors appointments done and still spend time with the kids.  I never thought I would be able to drive a school bus, but it's actually very easy and had helped us tremendously by not needing to use daycare. Have your wife look into it.  They are always hiring and they provide training. Many places have summer school as well.   Another part time job suggestion is stockers for grocery stores after hours. You're home, kids are tucked in bed and wife can work some late hours earning some much needed extra cash. If you're near a casino, check out the part time jobs there. \nAnother suggestion is enrolling just the kids in gov. insurance, or wife and kids, you get company insurance. Check out and see what options are available. What grocery store do you shop at? I ask because you said you're in FL. My family started shopping at Aldi and it really cut down the food bill and they have some really good stuff. I'd definitely say check them out if you're not already shopping there; might be able to save enough to keep your YMCA membership. Hang in there, brother. Check out /r/frugal.  I'm assuming you have cable & internet (the one that's contract until October?).  You can cut cable and just have internet with Hulu & an antenna and save about $60-$80 a month. When added to the savings after you drop the Y membership, it adds up. But if it is the one with the contract until October that's not very helpful right now :/  Might sound harsh. But your wife should start working. I mean she could even do something flexible such as: Uber, Postmates, Lyft, GrubHub, Dog Walking or any part-time job that fits good into her schedule. Your kids are already 6 and 4 - my friends that already have kids started working when kids were 2/3 years old.\n\nYou don't need a lot. Just a couple hundreds per month would put you at a decent living standard. I think? your wife could get benefits if she worked 15-20 hrs a week at Starbucks. She could work while you're home. Still, the point of the post is that, even when it looks like you're out of poverty, you're not out of poverty.\n\nI think a lot of people go through periods like this. Take a look at what you need vs what you want. I'd suggest cutting any memeberships or subscriptions you can. What about cell phone plans? Would pay-as-you-go be more effective? Internet at home is nice, but not absolutely necessary (which is hard to swallow, but it's true) -- especially if you're already paying for data on your phone. \n\nI'm not saying make these changes permanently, just cut down for 6 months and see where finances go. Two quick suggestions: have you tried applying for FL Healthy Kids for health insurance? Your kids may still qualify for Medicaid even if you and your wife do not.  And IF the kids no longer make the cutoff for Medicaid, they can still offer you the Healthy Kids plan with a subsidy. It's a great plan and if you can save money on it, even better. The application for FL Healthy Kids will basically run through all your options for discounted health insurance and try to work with your situation. It takes forever to get approved (a month or two), but well worth it if you qualify, which I think you would.\n\nSecond, I had a friend in the same situation as you, with a family of five. His wife was in school full time, but she ended up getting a part time job at Trader Joe's. Apparently, they have amazing insurance which is very affordable. Now that she has graduated, she plans on continuing to work some hours at TJ's because of the health insurance alone. Costco is another great place for cheap and good quality insurance options. I do agree with others that she should try and find a part time job though.   \n\nEdit: Added more info about FL Healthy Kids. If your kids are 6 and 4 it's probably a good idea for her I start working part time to help her transition to full time work when the youngest enters kindergarten next  year. In reference to running out of time: When you lose your insurance (in this case Medicaid), this can trigger a \"change in circumstances\" which causes you to get a special enrollment period.  Give a call to whatever agent handles the Healthcare Exchange in your area, they might be able to generate it for you.   saving ten dollars a month is not worth the enjoyment your family likely gets out of netflix. Pretty classic example of how the lower middle class is often not any better off than people living in poverty due to no longer qualifying for benefits and being taxed at a significantly higher rate.\n\nSucks, man. Wish I had some advice. Best of luck to you and your family. Not sure if your age of anything, but I joined the Air Force Reserves simply because of insurance. I went from paying $1000 a month for my family and each person had a $5000 deductible, to $210 a month for my family with a very small family deductible. It saved me about $15000 a year. It really a great idea if you qualify and are willing to give up 1 weekend a month to help your family out.  Clearly, your wife needs to get at least a part-time job. Preferably someplace that offers health insurance. This way, you could take the \"employee and kids\" rate and she'd be covered on her own.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the scenario my mother in law is in. They're retired on Medicare, but the supplemental policy for her is ridiculous! So, she works retail (at age 75!) a few hours a week and that just about covers her insurance.  I don't understand what the frontier bill is. Internet? That would be very high.\n\nAlso, I would shop around for new car insurance. I pay $140 a month for 3 cars in NC. 30+28 yr old couple.  To add with the exchange insurance, it was never really designed to be an option if your work provides the option. Although I hear Florida is pretty bad on Medicaid. I believe the state declined its expansion. What about Florida kidcare for the kids. It's insurance that costs 15-20$ a month. You should be able to qualify for CHIP in Florida.  If I remember correctly the cut off is ~4400/month for a family of 4.  I just recently got moved from the cheap $15/month plan to the ~400/ month plan for both kids. \n\nInsurance costs suck right now when your in the grey area of being above the poverty line but still tight on budgeting.  I miss the days when I was able to insure my whole family for $400 a month. It sucks, it really does.  My wife and I have gone through the exact same thing.  Quit a job I loved as a head brewer to get a job with a much higher pay.  After a year we got caught up on bills and get our credit high enough to take out consolidation loans and get a handle on our debt.  Now years later with both of us working we are basically able to just live, not have any extra money to save, not having any money to make a down payment on anything.  Best thing we did was get a divorce for a year.  Her and the kids got insurance covered for free, got food stamps, and she was able to get into college and finish her last year.  Now with her having a better job where she can work from home just get married at the courthouse again, family never even knew about it. I think you should check out Dave Ramsey.  Use your tax return to pay off your loans,  that will free some money up.  What is your current career?  I'm sure more debt is the last thing you want, but could consolidating your CC's & contracts into a single loan save you money on a monthly basis? \n\nIt might mean more expenditure over time but if it means each month is livable then it could be a viable last resort.\n\nThough as others have said the ideal is for your wife to pick up a part time job to pay for the insurance.. at least until you've paid off those smaller debts  This is essentially the problem with government benefits, they penalize you for trying to improve your families situation, it is why there is massive gaming of the system, best of luck, I'm rooting for you. I don't know if you will be able to find cheaper (equivalent) health insurance on the open market. The whole point of employer insurance is that they are paying for a big chunk of the cost. \n\nDo they have a high-deductible plan? That would even a cheaper monthly option, but has its own drawbacks.... with young kids I imagine you go to doctor frequently, and with HDP, you will be footing most of the bill. But you can pay it through the associated HSA. It's not very everyone, but it works for some people. \n\nAs to everything else... lots of good advice in this thread. It really sounds like you need a second income. Either wife part time, or you take on a second part time job. \n\nIf you don't already have one, you need a budget. And you need to get rid of that credit card debt as soon as feasibly possible. Once you get out from under the thumb of high interest, never decreasing monthly minimum payments, you'll have more money to use. And then you need to start saving for an emergency, otherwise you will inevitably go into credit card debt again. \n\nCongrats on the job. The money situation will still be rough until you kill all that debt. It will take time, and effort, and some sacrifice. But you can do it. I know you can. Good luck.  Not really a suggestion but this might help peace of mind a little; I'm pretty sure you're math is a little off in regards to your income. You're doubling your biweekly check to get your monthly income but in reality there are closer to 4.3 weeks in a month than exactly 4. That means you're making about $200 a month more on average than you have on your spreadsheet.  Divorce wife, have her apply for government benefits as single parent. Jk this is fraud. Have you thought about donating plasma? It only takes about 2 hours a week and each of you could earn $70 a week. Doesn't sound like a lot but if you both do it that is $560  every four weeks. Plus they offer free daycare while you are there. Don't be afraid of it, you get used to it.  Congrats on the raise.\n\nAssuming you start buying the family health insurance, and if you count for debt payment as saving -- which they are since they don't decrease your net worth -- then you currently have around 10% saving rate. That's great! Keep it up and even bring it up, by doing things like\n\n* Buy a 24-pack of LED light bulb [at amazon](https://www.amazon.com/ViriBright-Technology-60-Watt-Replacement/dp/B01LZEBSCG/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1485650618&sr=8-5&keywords=led+bulb+pack) for $40, it will cut the lighting part of your monthly electricity bill by six-fold, pay for itself inside of a month, then turn into savings.\n* Cancel the Frontier cable even if you have to pay the cancellation fee. Here too, the expense will pay for itself inside of a month or two, then turn into savings.\n* Look at refinancing your credit card debt against the equity you have in your house (a cash-out mortgage refinance), or against the value of your cars (a title loan). You will likely be able to get a lower rate and negotiate a longer term. Both will lower your monthly payment amount.\n* If you can't refinance to a lower rate, call each lender and try to negotiate a longer term. Explain your situation. Tell them the current arrangement is creating a family hardship, since it is preventing you from obtaining health insurance, which places you at risk of unexpected financial trouble if a health emergency should occur. There is a good chance they will seek to help you.\n* If you can't refinance at all, look at taking advantage of credit cards that [offer to new members interest-free transfer from old cards](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/top-credit-cards/nerdwallets-best-balance-transfer-credit-cards/?trk=nw_gn_4.0), sometimes for as long as 15 months. When the first period is over, transfer to another card with such an offer, and so forth. End with the [American Express Blue Cash](https://www.nerdwallet.com/card-details/card-name/American-Express-Blue-Cash), which gives 3% cash back on groceries -- that's a free $10/month.\n* Look at refinancing your student debt with a lower rate with [sofi.com](http://sofi.com) or [earnest.com](https://www.earnest.com/)\n\nOnce you have the lower minimum payments, set a saving rate goal. Keep 10% as now, or go up to 15% or 20%. Use the extra saving fraction to build an emergency saving cushion. Once you have that, place the extra \"saving\" money towards the loan with the highest rate until it goes to zero. Then target the next highest-rate loan, and so forth. Or do a [debt snowball](https://www.nerdwallet.com/blog/finance/consolidate-credit-card-debt-personal-loan/), by targeting the smallest loan first.\n\nGood luck! Employer is really screwing you with those rates...those look like monthly rates...so basically they should be cut in half. Not really a financial answer, but for the families sake keep Netflix. Why are you paying $180 a month for insurance? \n\nWhat is more important Frontier or insurance? Your wife needs to get a job.  To all the people suggesting wife work evenings, I think you may never have stayed home with a young child. It is exhausting! To spend all day with a toddler and then go work 4-5 hrs...I don't know. It's a solid idea, but... If your wife gets a part time job get a job with tips, when I was part time I would get 10.00 base and 3-4 extra an hour on a slow day. On a weekend night I'd get 6-7 extra an hour. This was serving ice cream.  Florida kid care is Medicaid for children. The premiums depend on your income and household size. Look into it and see if your children qualify.  What about Florida kidcare for the kids. It's insurance that costs 15-20$ a month. Insurance is very expensive.  While the numbers may seem high for what you have to pay bi-weekly, your employer is often kicking in 3-4 times as much.\n\nA couple things come to mind:\n\n* Have you looked into part-time jobs your wife may be able to take while you watch the kids on the weekends?  Something like working at the local grocery store, department store, etc.  Places that are flexible with hours, days, etc.  I know a friend whose wife works at Macy's in the evenings and she enjoys it -- plus they get a discount, which they use for children's clothing.\n\n* Look into having family, relatives, etc. do child care. That would help your wife be able to get into the working world quicker.\n\n* I know this isn't ideal, but working a second job until you get out of this bind.  Again, think places like a department store, Lowes, Home Depot, etc.\n\nGood luck!\n I work with the marketplace and even if you hear back from your state CHIP program after open enrollment ends you will qualify for a special enrollment period, because you just got a new job.  If you are using and enjoying the Y or the kids are go in and explain your situation to the membership director. Most likely they will get you on financial aid or a scholarship. They will try as much as they can to help you out. I work for a ymca and we bend backwards all the time to help people out. Wife's gotta work, man. Not gonna be a fun conversation but life's not always fun :) \n\nIs there any family/friends that can provide help in the beginning with the kids? Once they get in school it will be much more doable but multiple streams of income is how everybody makes it out of the middle class Are you sure those rates are biweekly? That sounds like a lot. My insurance (for a single person) is $33.50 every pay period (the 15th and 30th of every month). Does your job only offer one type of plan? I know my job offers like 30 plans for Blue Cross Blue Shield and Blue Care Network. The cheapest plan is actually free.\n\nIs there a preschool your wife can put your 4 year old in? Have you applied for Medicaid again? Sometimes if you give enough evidence of the hardship, they will approve it even though the income is higher than it should be. There are food pantries all over the place (at least where I live) where you can get food for a low price. I don't know if you have it in Florida, but in Michigan (at least where I am), United Way has 211 available where you can call and they will connect you with help. It can be housing, food assistance, bill pay, etc. Since you are the only earner in the family, you probably don't need two cars. You can sell one for a cash infusion, and lower your monthly insurance payments.\n Sign up for your work insurance of $519. The amount is taken out pre-tax so it's not $519 coming out of your take home pay. Maybe like $400. And you do have $366 remaining so you can adjust the difference between groceries.\n\nIt leaves you with $0 remaining for disposable income but at least your family has insurance. Make sure when you file taxes this year you look into the state and federal EITC tax credit! It is mostly meant to benefit low and moderate income families with children and could free up some funds for other things.  Wife working seems like the answer here, definitely somewhere that provides childcare or at least a good discount on it. Also I wouldn't rule out debt consolidation if you could handle a little more interest for fewer monthly payments To add to the existing advice, instead of going through the marketplace for the kids, enroll them in [Florida Kid Care](http://www.floridakidcare.org/). Then enroll you and your wife in the employer sponsored coverage.  [deleted] Can YMCA and one car go for now? Don't get rid of netflix. 9 bucks for hours and hours of entertainment, what would you replace that with?  I punched your information into the Obamacare search engine, \n\nThe [Florida Blue HMO (A BlueCross BlueShield FL Company) \u00b7 MyBlue Silver 1604B](https://www.healthcare.gov/see-plans/#/plan/results/30252FL0070007/details) Obamacare plan is only **$230.83** to cover your and your wife, with the kids covered by CHIP, with zero deductible. It's well worth it and affordable in your budget.\n All I want or am able to add to this conversation, not being American and not dealing with your unique (?) challenges is this: that you're struggling sucks, but you're a good dad and a good provider for reaching out and looking for a better way. Congratulations on he new job and pay bump. I sincerely hope you can find he happy median that allows you all to thrive. Keep looking out for the family, your persistence is full of honour. \ud83d\udc4d So I may make over 100k now, but 4 years ago I was supporting myself and my wife on two part time jobs making 9/hr in one and 9.35/hr in the other. I worked 64 hours a week in total (I went an average of 3 months strait with only 2 days off total for about a year.). Made about 1800 after taxes. After all the bills, food, and debt payments we were left wit about 300 a month. Somehow that money always wound up going to some unexpected cost that popped up like doctor visits, but I finally saw the light...\n\nTHIS is where the advice/help comes in.\n\n\nAlthough that 300 often seemed to be gone, I did manage to pay off the wife's debt to her school by putting 100/month extra into it.\nThe debt to her school was our smallest debt/loan. She owed about $600 when I started doing this, and the minimum was 200 a month. So it only took 2 months to pay off instead of 3 because I put an extra 100 a month toward it... it red lined us hard for 2 months.\nThat 3rd month was like a god send. It felt like the equivalent of having an extra $300 a month.\n\nFor you, that Terminix Loan you owe 400 on would be to you what my wife's college is to us. Instead of making the minimum payment, go red line for a month or two and get it paid off now.\n\nThe next step is to take that normal payment amount that you have been paying to Terminix and put it toward your next lowest loan/debt... especially if it has a high interest rate.\nAlthough $60 doesn't seem like much, that extra 60 a month goes strait to principle. This will lower the amount of interest being paid by quite a bit on your 2.3k debt. It will also be the equivalent of making an extra monthly payment every few months. With my student loans I actually can go 3 months without paying it now if I for some reason needed to because I have paid enough in advance.\n\nThis $60 becomes a bit of an emergency fund as well. If you have something happen and you red line too hard... don't put the extra $60 toward it that month.\n\nOnce you end up paying off the next lowest debt, move the entire payment of the one you just paid off to the lowest after that.\n\nThis will quickly snowball into paying off your debt crazy fast and thus giving you much more money to fall back on every month in case of emergency. Aca being known as affordable is the biggest joke ever. I feel bad for people that dont have jobs that are forced into this pain.  army reserves and take $200 a month family tricare plan is an option possibly. Your wife needs to get a job.  Like others have said food pantries are great.  My mom did that for a while while she was unemployed and they gave her enough for a family of four most times even after she stated she only had one mouth to feed. $500 is a lot for food man.  I eat around 3,000 calories a day and spend around $50 bucks a week including toiletries and vitamins and much of my food is protein.  \n\nAlso If you don't mind spending Fridays and Saturdays working try doing Uber during the busy hours. How long has it been since you switched jobs? I believe you have 60 days to enroll in a qualifying insurance plan under Obamacare.  It's called the special enrollment period. Good luck. Drop the YMCA and Frontier.  Breaking the contract is probably cheaper than paying them until October.  Why is that bill so high anyway?  You must have some crazy fast internet at that rate.  Can you lower the speed to the minimum at least?\n\nA part time job for your wife would do wonders for your situation, or one for yourself.  Delivering pizzas or something could have you out of that credit card debt in no time if you really took it seriously. If you lived near me I'd offer to watch your kids for free. I wish more people would help people with their time rather than just giving money to a charity. When I was young my mom was single had two sometimes three jobs. Thank goodness we had a wonderful woman who watched me for almost nothing. Good luck with everything!  I'm a SAHM - 7 year old and 7 month old twins, however I'm always looking at ways to make some bucks for my family. \n\n1. Sell off outgrow kid clothes/toys etc. Ebay/Craigslist/FB rummage sale groups/consignment stores. \n\n1a. I also shop thrift stores and find items to resell via the above methods.\n\n2. I signed up to be a worker on Amazon.  Just need Internet and can pick your jobs. I prefer data entry.  https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome Get a second job, and/or wife get a job on alternate shift for childcare purposes. Apply for government aid, worst they can do is say no. Get on ACA because it actually helps on taxes during returns, even if you scrape by. Take kids to free vacation bible schools. It is basically free daycare at a church. How religious you are is not important. Sorry I'm late, but I think donating plasma would be a great way of making some extra income without much extra work. You can make about 140$ a week between you and your wife. Biolife is my go to center.  519 biweekly? thats crazy At $130 for electric. I'd say that's pretty high.\n\nKeep the netflix. Turn the lights off. Hey man I know I'm late to this and I don't really have any advice, I just wanted to say that your post is really inspirational. You're doing everything right budget, diet, and exercise-wise, and you're willing to ask for help. \n\nI'd say that right now you're a little stuck, bills-wise, but once those debts are gone you'll have a little more breathing room and maybe then you can get insured. \n\nAnyway, I just wanted to say that you're doing a great job, keep kicking ass and good luck.  join the rest of the country... its insane\n\nEither you pay extremely high premiums or you pay extremely high deductibles\n\n10 years ago I was paying $140 a month for full HMO coverage with a $300 a year deductible.. no per office visit cost.. $2 per prescription...  and $15 more for dental insurance with $2000 a year covered.\n\nIf you aren't in a job where your insurance is part of your compensation you are screwed and the only places that is happening is in Government work... \n\nI know a guy making three times as much as me and he can't afford it for his family.. \n\nits impossible.. just simply impossible.... \n I know I'm really late here but hopefully you see this and it can help. One slightly better option for health coverage is Liberty Health Share. They have a few options that are decent coverage with a way lower deductible than 7k. It isn't a whole lot cheaper but you will save a small amount and have much better coverage than what you get through the marketplace. It may look weird at first but it is pretty reputable and I've heard a lot of positive things about it.\n\nGood luck to you and your family.\n couple of things... not sure if any have been mentioned. if they have... forgive me.\n\n1.) GEICO... that insurance is way tooo expensive. Really calculate your annual mileage, that's where insurance companies get you. From the looks of it, it seems like you're paying for two people who work and commute like two working adults, unless you have citations and accidents that are driving up the premium or your credit score is dragging it. Or you have full coverage insurance on both vehicles. Definitely consult with the insurance company. Also if you're getting hit with surcharges for monthly payments, linking your bank account to direct deposit your monthly premium should reduce those fees. But still shop around.\n\n2.) Utilities, check to see if the electric/gas/water/internet companies offer assistance. They usually do. If they don't, check to see if your county or state offers a program to assist. \n\n3.) (a) Mortgage, check to see if you're state offers a mortgage credit that you can apply for. This will help with your exemption/deductions on your taxes.\n\n(b) calculate your annual mortgage interest and add that to your exemption you'll be updating on your w4 allowance certificate.\n\n4.) Take your first paystub of the year (that has your expected average wage), and multiply the items on there by the number of expected paystubs you expect to receive throughout the year and pump it into a spreadsheet (i.e. if you get a paycheck every week, multiply it by 50 or 52 (whichever gets you to your annual salary amount). Multiply your ss, fed, state tax, etc... by expected number of paystubs--then take this and run a scenario on turbotax, (it's free) where you're filing taxes for 2017, (but you'll really be doing it for 2016), to see how much tax you are over paying or under paying...(in you're case probably over paying). Then go and redo your w4 payroll allowance certificate with your employer.\n\n5.) Student loan, see if you can determine how much interest you'll be paying this year and add this to your w4 exemption amount.\n\n6.) Slowly dedicate a small amount to a rainy day fund if you don't have one.\n\n7.) There are interesting articles under which you can claim exemptions or modify your exemptions for health insurance. Research and see which apply. get a health insurance quote through the marketplace using your AGI from the turbo tax scenario you ran and see what works or if your employer option is a better fit. You can always appeal the marketplace for a lower premium. Also when you get the premium, go back and redo your turbotax scenario and add it to your list of w4 dollar amount exemptions which you wish to withhold.\n\n8.) I think i saw someone mention that you need to update the number of people you are claiming. [removed] Have you thought about joining the military reserves? Tricare reserve is about 200 a month for the family with a 1k cap I have analyzed your budget, here are my suggestions:\n\nStop using so much electricity at home.  Main culprits are heat/air and leaving lights on.\n\nAdjust your car insurance, choose the coverage levels manually to get the rate down.  I pay $60/mo for an SUV with decent coverage in an expensive area.\n\nThe Frontier bill is insane.  You should be able to get internet for under $40.  You don't need cable.  Keep netflix, it's cheap.  Find a way to get out of the contract.\n\nThat YMCA is expensive, there must be cheaper options around for exercise?\n\nLook into a consolidation loan for the cards (I'm not an expert at that)\n\nYou don't need to spend so much on groceries.  Buy bulk rice and beans.  Go to cheaper grocery stores.  Your family can eat for $100/mo until you are stable.\n\nThese ideas should save you $300-$600/mo.\n\nAlso, look for leaks.  Have you and your wife both write down any \"other\" purchases made every day. Stop spending money on shit. I mean it. Like anything that isn't needed to live. Turn the thermostat down. Cut cable. Cut internet. Sell a car. You need food and a place to live. And healthcare. You are going to have to suck it up.  There are a lot of part time jobs out there that suck, but include benifits that are cheaper. Might consider the wife getting one of those jobs or you picking up a second one.  So I might be late to the party, and this may have already been mention...but me and my husband ran into this as well when we started making too much for ACA but not enough to afford regular insurance that wasn't like basically not having insurance at all. We decided to go on a credit share called [Christian Healthcare Ministries](http://www.chministries.org/) , though there are a ton of credit shares out there that aren't religious-based. For us, it is $90/month for basically catastrophic insurance ($5000 deductible), and then we put $200/month (usually) into a health savings account. This works out great for us since we just need to occasionally go to the doctor, but covers us if something really bad happens. I'm having issues too with the ACA. Everyone is im sure. At least a lot more people than are letting on.\n\nI was doing great affording all my stuff normally, not having to worry about this healthcare and not having worry about being charged a fee from my tax returns...and now I'm not getting any tax return because of this crap because I can't afford healthcare.\n\nThis shit needs to go away, honestly.  Insurance is cheaper than a chronic disease. If you have too much debt I recommend doing a chapter 13. That lets you pay off a fraction of the debt. People are always resistant to bankruptcy because of the shame associated but it's there to help you just as much as the food stamps and Medicaid were I'd advise cutting your car insurance.  Since you're driving a beater, liability only.  Raise any deductibles to the highest.   I don't normally post on these types of things but I'm almost sick that 90% of the answers here are that your wife needs a part time job. She should be able to be at home with your children teaching them what school doesn't. \n\nMy advice is start saving. Your wife can coupon using sites like krazycouponlady.com which gives advice on money daving tools. You can also use pennyhoarder.com(I think) to find small side money makers. \n\nYou can also call your mortgage company to renegotiate your mortgage. For example, I did this and got my boll down from 714 to 625 at Wells Fargo. Frontier may also have special promotions to give you an amount of money off for so many months(worked with Directv for 5 years. All you have to do is say you are considering leaving because of your bill amount and they usually offer you something.)\n\nI do agree with dropping things you may not used often like your Y membership. \n\nGood luck. This is a struggle too many of us deal with. Have you talked to an insurance broker? Not sure if they could help but it might be worth a conversation.  If it's active in your area, maybe you and your wife can find odd jobs (errands, chores) here:\n\nhttps://www.taskrabbit.com/\n\nYour wife might even be able to do some of them with the 4-year-old tagging along. Even with insurance, I can't get them to pay for anything. \n\nAt this point it would be cheaper to not have insurance, even with the fee. How many hours a week do you work and how much are you making? Does your wife have any training/education? You definitely don't have enough to support a family of 4 on one income,  From a quick glance at your tax liability, it looks like you are being over withheld. Your tax liability may be 0 at the end of the year. If that is the case, going on your work's family plan (which is pre-tax) and increasing your exemptions may make the net out of pocket cost of your work insurance $0. \n\nThe irs has a withholding calculator. From a quick run through (assuming your paid bi-monthly and have only received one paycheck) it suggest someone with 2 kids earning 45000 a year would not have any tax liability.  Of course you would need to use your own numbers, but you may be able to significantly reduce the taxes taken out of your paycheck, in exchange for not getting as large of a refund (or possibly no refund depending). Note that you wouldn't be losing  money, rather you would be getting it ratably on your paychecks rather than in a lump sum when you file your return.  If your wife is looking into part time work, pick a place with excellent benefits. She may not get paid much but the savings on healthcare are well worth it. I've heard good things about Target and Starbucks that only require 25 hours a week to be eligible. The plan through your employer is pretax. Also it wood be a qualifying event of your kids qualify for other insurance so you could drop the kids once the chip response comes back.  My parents who are religious were having to pay about $850 a month for the two of them.   They went to Christian Healthcare Ministries and got a huge discount.  It's one of the exceptions under ACA.   If you are religious or willing to fake it for cheap insurance might be worth looking at.  Financial assistance at the Y is great. You may qualify for full or partial. This goes for membership, after school care & summer camps. \nFor the medical, your employer option is most likely going to be your best bet. Wait to hear back from the CHIP programs for your kids, you should qualify. \n You don't qualify for ACA I believe if your work offers healthcare. You referred to CHIP for your kids, I don't know if this is the same, but I had heard of Florida KidCare, which offers low cost premium for children on a sliding scale depending on your income.  Hope this is an additional option for you. Good luck to you.  Beware the ACA prices, you may not be seeing the right price. If when you were looking at the prices you marked that you were eligible for health care through work you may have been excluded from the list of people the ACA site was pricing out for healthcare and that $466 / month price may be just for your wife.\n\nFor example, if you went to the see prices and plans link and clicked the \"eligible for health coverage through a job, Medicare, Medicaid or CHIP\" checkbox under your information and don't check it for your spouse, for my state, the monthly premium is listed at $354 / month for the cheapest plan. If you uncheck just that one box, and try again, the premiums jump to $709 / month. Hopefully you've got the right price but just to warn you. You could consider dropping down to one vehicle. This may not be worth it if your cars are paid off and cheap to maintain, but it's something to consider. The goal would be to cut both your insurance and gas costs.  YMCA will grant you a scholarship if you can't afford it for your family. I grew up going to the Y in a family of 7. I think my mom paid $5 a month for all of us. \n\nEdit: also look for gleaner groups in your area. I grew up on that shit too! There is a lot of shit food for free but the produce gleans are where it is at. Learn to preserve food, glean fruit and veggies all summer and preserve them. I was raised by a single mom with 6 mouths to feed that made 30k/year. We also never paid for recycling or trash, but would instead sort our recycling and trash and periodically take to recycling centers and/or the dump.  I'm not sure if this has been said as I haven't checked a lot of comments but as far as the ACA goes; you're probably exempt from penalty based on your income. I can't double check or look into it at the moment but a quick google of \"IRS ACA Exemptions\" will get you what you need to know.\n\n-I work in tax compliance. Happy to help with any questions  Did you go all the way through the insurance application to see what your tax credits could be? Definitely cover your kids through ChIP. I've used it before-- basically like Medicaid with a $20/month premium. With that income and a family of four you'd certainly qualify. Then at least the kiddos are protected. If you are in FL, have your wife check out your local Publix store for job openings. They have excellent benefits, health care, credit union, tuition reimbursement and free lunch.   Considering you barely made it into the premium tax credit range you should receive that subsidiary payment each month to lower your monthly premium. However, I assume it's a very small credit that doesn't help you very much. I believe you also falsely filled out the application, as the ACA clearly outlines if you  are eligible for coverage through an employer you will not be eligible for the premium tax credit. Now as far as the advice I can give you. If you are residents of the state of Florida and wish to file an exemption from the IRS penalty for not having qualified health insurance you will receive the exemption because Florida did not expand their Medicaid benefits. This is only if you don't want coverage. Because you are offered insurance through your job I would recommend getting the coverage for yourself and having just your wife and kids apply through the marketplace. The plan premiums will be lower and the kids will still be eligible for CHIP. Also while the kids wait for eligibility results from CHIP you should update your Marketplace application to show they were found ineligible for Medicaid or CHIP in the past 90 days. This is required to add them to your wife's plan and to avoid a gap in coverage if they are found not eligible. A CSR rep for the federal marketplace should be able to confirm all this information and assist you further. I would look into blue collar work.\n\nI was always broke until I joined the pipefitters local in my state. Today I don't need to worry about Obamacare because the job has full benefits.\n\nYou already have a family and want more money and a better quality of life today and can't wait 5 years to get through an apprenticeship if you have a CDL with hazmat endorsement (takes about 4-6 weeks) in Texas or North Dakota that is worth about $80,000-120,000/yr companies give you full benefits.\n\nFlorida doesn't have a good Union presence but there is always construction/maintenance work in that area also. Chemical operators also  require minimal training and are paid well. I don't think you'll have to pay any penalty this year with the new president. Explain to your wife that she needs to get a job. If it has come to the point of being on food stamps she needs to help out. [removed] Ugh, this sucks. I am so mad at states that did not accept the federal money for extending subsidies to lower wage earners. \n\nWhat is divorce like in FL? How fast? Is it possible you would come out ahead if you and your wife officially divorced, and she and the kids could be eligible for medicaid and you pay for your employee only insurance?\n\nIn the mean time, even if it's a huge hit, I think you do need to keep your insurance current. Not just against an unexpected catastrophe, but in case there are changes to ACA that might make insurance even more expensive, or unobtainable, for pre-existing conditions.\n\n Hasn't the tax penalty for no insurance been removed this year? Welcome to the \"middle class\" not poor enough to qualify not rich enough to pay  You may find these links helpful:\n\n- [Budgeting wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/budgeting)\n- [Spreadsheets section of the Tools wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/tools#wiki_redditor_created.3A)\n\n*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* Call your state elected officials and ask them to expand Medicaid as provided for under the ACA. Did you check for plans on healthcare.gov? You may qualify for a subsidy under ACA. Put in your income on there and it will tell you.  Maybe because the thread hasn't been around long enough you haven't gotten much good advice yet or maybe because it's saturday morning..\n\nCar insurance you can go down on that, but you should consider the safety of your neighborhood, and how good you are at driving. If you only get basic required liability it'll be much cheaper(about $40 per car), at least you could eliminate vandalism insurance.\n\nInternet/phone are always negotiable so call into negotiate. You might be able to lower the price even if you're in contract or get out of the contract early, at least I'm able to with AT&T. They should be helpful if you tell them it's hurting you guys from living.\n\nThe loans you might be able to consolidate some for a cheaper interest rate.\n\nThe food well is the easiest part if you wanna live on rice/beans/potatoes for awhile. Shopping for groceries is a skill though. Like you can save money by shopping only on certain days, or waiting till a certain time to buy large amounts of groceries while they are on sale, or going to a different store to buy 88 cent eggs vs $2 eggs. It's different per location. Ask the store and find out what day they mark prices down. Many of your loans are about to get paid off, so that should open up more.  As mentioned your wife can find a part-time job.\n\nYou also live in Florida.  That is heck of a nice climate.  You should be riding a bicycle as much as you can, unless you live in some car-crazy place where it is dangerous to cycle.  As well, you should be fruit and vegetable gardening.  That is a great climate for that, and it is shocking how much you can produce for so little, in a small space.  I am vegetable gardener here in Canada, and I am able to produce a lot of food for 2/3 of year.  You can start from seeds yourself, and make your own compost from kitchen and yard scraps.  You could also plant citrus, avocado, and other tropical fruit trees, and could even use cuttings from neighbours trees so you don\u2019t have to spend at the nursery.  It is also a super relaxing and rewarding hobby. You likely qualify for a subsidy because you're a family. I would look into ACA subsidies with the broker. Should help you cover costs. Light bill? What? Is this electricity? Switch to LEDs Wait, I thought the insurance companies give you a discount for the amount you spend at a gym? Have you reached your maximum earning potential for your job and experience level? I checked Glassdoor salaries for Corporate Trainer in Florida (I picked St Petersburg, but that was a random city choice), and it looks like you could be making more. I'm seeing salaries up to $58K. And this is keeping in mind that the salaries on Glassdoor are sometimes out of date, so it could be higher. My rule of thumb when looking at averages and salary ranges is this: am I an average employee? No. My work is above average. So I should be looking for a company that will pay me an above average salary.\n\nCheck [Glassdoor](https://www.glassdoor.com/) and [Paysa](https://www.paysa.com/). I know you just started the new job and the pay bump is significant, but don't assume you've maxed out. Next time you make a switch, make sure you get the most you can for your time, expertise, and energy. If I were in your shoes, I'd insure myself and my children.  Insuring children is generally the most expensive.  Children are more likely to need medication and have bad illnesses they need to get over.  A responsible adult could go years without going to a doctor (mind you nothing serious happens).\n\nHave your wife find a job that offers health insurance and be a dual income family.\n\nOr as others have said, she could go into child care, watch your kids for free, and then watch others kids for profit and then pay for obama care on her own (while it still exists).\n\nThe entire time this is happening, I'd be working on my skills to get a better paying job (E.g. say Web Development boot camps, online courses \"for free\") and learning how to do something that pays better.\n\nE.g. I make nearly double what you make and all I do is analyze web site code all day.  It took some time to learn, but I don't find it to be really that hard.  Plus high end jobs like I have (Fortune 1000, corporate) have really good insurance \"family plan for $300 or so\" but then you're making enough not to care if the family plan is $500 a month.\n\nHowever, depending on your wife and how much she loves you, she could leave you, then cream you with child support and she could go back on food stamps and medicaid with the kids and or get alimony from you if she doesn't work.... Then you're making 45k, paying child support and alimony... Shitty.\n [deleted] With a family of 4 making 45K/yr you and your wife will qualify for a subsidy to help pay for an ACA policy.  It won't be a huge amount but might make it more affordable for you.  Not sure if the amount your quoted includes any subsidy or not. \n\nYour children most likely will qualify for CHIP as well but you may have some co-pays or co-insurance.   BTW: you can always apply for an ACA policy under a special enrollment if your income has changed or you or anyone you are applying for lost insurance coverage that past 60 days. [removed] Not a mega budget solution but something to consider to stretch the food $ more: How hard is it to grow food vegetables in Florida?  Do you have a yard or at least patio where you could put up a few containers?  At my old apartment (CA) I had a super sunny balcony where I grew cucumbers and tomatoes out of reusable grocery bags and a few fresh herbs like mint and basil.  Current neighbors have a zucchini plant that goes nuts yearly. You might even be able to find the supplies for free or cheap on freecycle.org, craigslist or offerup, a lot of people start seedlings expecting some to die and wind up with more than they needed. Bonus: gardening is something kids may enjoy/learn from! As for Chip. If you fail to get it, you can still enroll your kids. Enroll yourself and spouse now, apply for Chip, and IF chip turns you down, you can go back and enroll your kids even after open enrollment ends. This happened to my wife and I. Being denied coverage elsewhere or loosing coverage qualifies you for special enrollment (any enrollment outside the open enrollment period).\n Didn't read 300 comments, but consider a healthshare. We pay $400/mo for our family and we have a $1500 annual deductible. We use liberty healthshare I make a similar salary but my wife has a job making around $30k a year. We have a house and one kid on the way which we should have room for. We don't live a lavish lifestyle or anything but are able to splurge a little. If we had a second kid we could make it work. It would just be much much tighter. I highly recommend that your wife does her best to find a job. We wouldn't be able to do it if she didn't have her full time job.  In Florida there is a state assisted insurance plan available for children, and based on your house hold income called [healthy kids]( https://www.healthykids.org/).  Depending on the state you reside in. You maybe able to use a loophole. If your wife applies to Medicaid along with the child. Have her use the married, but separated status. You can even live in the same house with this status, but not the same room. You need to speak with a health insurance agent in your state. If she files wrong there is a huge fine.

All loans have an identical interest rate of 6.8% through Nelnet.  Current minimum payments are 2250/month. \nLoans are broken down as follows:\n\nLoan A: Stafford Subsidized. Outstanding balance: $8.8k\n\nLoan B: Stafford Unsubsidized: Outstanding Balance:\t$43k\n\nLoan C: Direct Subsidized: Outstanding Balance:\t$8.8k\n\nLoan D: Direct Unsubsidized: \nOutstanding Balance:\t$50.6k\n\nLoan E: Stafford Subsidized: Outstanding Balance:\t$8.8k\n\nLoan F: Stafford Unsubsidized: \nOutstanding Balance:\t$45.5k\n\nLoan G: Direct Subsidized: Outstanding Balance:\t$8.8k\n\nLoan H: Direct unsubsidized: Outstanding Balance:\t$22.2k\n\nThe short version is that I was talking with my mom about my plans for paying off my loans, and how I was trying to pay it off in 4-6 years, rather than the 9 I have left . I can currently pay $250/month over the minimum payment, but I get a raise in the next 6 months, which will allow me to pay off an additional $1k-$2k/month.  My grandma offered to loan me $50k at a 3% interest rate to help reduce the overall interest I'll pay over time.  I should point out that I'll be paying her back on a 10-year plan starting immediately.  Once I'm done with the other loans I'll shift everything over to pay her off faster.\n\n**Question**\nI have the $50k sitting in my checking account at the moment. I know that if I just pay directly to nelnet it will be distributed across all my loans so that, roughly 25% of each will be paid off.  However, what I don't understand is whether or not the type of loan (Stafford vs. Direct, Subsidized vs. Unsubsidized) makes any difference in terms of which I pay off.   Do the larger debts benefit from being paid off faster here?  Motivation isn't a particular issue here, the avalanche vs. snowball method doesn't really matter to the question I'm asking. I just can't find a clear answer about whether it makes any difference which of these I pay off rest, either in terms of legality differences between the terms of some sort of math issue I'm not considering.\n\n**tldr**\nDon't know the difference between Stafford & Direct or between Subsidized and Unsubsidized once I'm in repayment.  Can't determine if it matters mathematically which one I pay off.\n\n/edit - additional details and formatting.", "title": "[debt] $197k student loans @6.8%. Paying off $2500/month. Family loaned $50k to help with interest, how best to distribute?", "comments": "There is no difference between them that I know of once in repayment. And since they are all the same interest rate, the debt snowball method would work. Pay off the smallest ones first then move up to the more expensive ones. All else being equal, subsidized loans are better than unsubsidized. One example is that if something happens down the road and you need loan deferment, you wouldn't accrue interest on subsidized loans, while you would on unsubsidized. It may be an unlikely scenario, but considering the identical interest rates, you might as well direct the cash to paying off the unsubsidized loans first. Once you're in repayment, there's no difference.  If they're all the same interest rate, it does not matter mathematically which ones you pay off.\n\nHowever, you should be able to direct the payments to a specific loan.  Call Nelnet and ask.   Are you sure all your student loans are exactly the same rate? If they vary you want to put any extra cash towards the highest interest rates first.\n\nAlso just FYI make sure you think of the $50k as a loan and not a gift, if that's what it is. You've basically just refinanced a portion of your loans. This will save you around $10k+ in interest but just make sure you do not mentally think that you are done with debt once you get rid of the student loans... In 6 years that $50k loan will have grown to about $60k.\n\nAlternately, you could figure out how much this loan is going to cost your GM and ask for that as a gift. E.g. lets say you pay her back as a lump sum in 6 years, she will get back $59.7k. On the other hand if she put that money into the stock market she would probably average around 6% returns (after 6 years that would be $70.9k). If instead of lending you the money she gave you an $8k gift and then invested the remaining $42k in the stock market, she would end up with $59.7k. An $8k gift would basically cost her the same amount and might be more straightforward and easier for everyone. As others have said it doesn't matter as far as long term which one you pay off.  The only side note I was going to say is that if Nelnet breaks these up individually you may want to completely pay one or more off IF you're interested in buying a house in the near future.  The reason being that the banks care about what your monthly debt obligation is.  So if paying loans off completely lowers your overall monthly debt due, it would look better on a loan application.  If you're not planning your on buying a house before all the debt is gone then it doesn't matter what you do!  Congrats though!! For psych reasons I'd pay off A, C, E, and G and as much of H as possible. Target the rest of H this year (min payments on the rest) and by 2018 you'll only have 3 loans to think about.\n\nUnrelated, where'd you go to school? Just so you are aware, student loan interest paid on loans from family members are not tax deductible, [according to the IRS](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p970/ch04.html#en_US_2016_publink1000178234). Based on how aggressively you're repaying these loans, it seems likely that you're well into either the 28 or 33% tax brackets. If that's the case, your true effective interest rate rate for the 6.8% loans is between 4.5% and 5.0%, depending on you rate. That difference may (and may not) change your calculus on taking a loan from family, and the potential conflicts that that could entail. I know this is not answering OP's question.. but how tf do people pay for this? Even if you were extremely lucky and found a dream job and made $100k/yr your first year, paying this stuff off would be hard and take years.. if you couldn't dish out $2.2k/month for the loans, what happens? You pay even more in interest? $2.2k/month is actually the total salary of most Americans in the middle states, even ones with a college education make barely more than that.\n\nWhat if you just didn't pay, went to collections, and went bankrupt? Wouldn't that remove the debt you owe on the loans? You probably would never be able to get a credit card anymore, but if you can get a good job with your degree surely that has to be more worth than paying $200k for that degree.\n\nIf you make less than 197k/yr, even sitting in jail for a year in return for the student loans would be financially correct, do people go to jail for not paying student loans? This concept of paying $200k to go to a good college is still so crazy to me, if you and your family were in the top 5% financially, it's still hard to pay First of all, I would look into Refinancing them all into a lower interest rate and then applying the 50k. There are downsides so refinancing like you can't go into forbearance or do IBR but sounds like you're gainfully employed and can make the payments. Otherwise maybe apply the payment directly to some of the smaller ones to pay them off.  off-topic comment but posts like these, makes me grateful that i belong to a culture where my parents are expected to pay all the expenses if they could.\ngood luck for OP. really. Since you are already out of school subsidized vs unsubsidized does not matter. The difference is that with the subsidized loan, the government pays the interest while you are in school. Unsubsidized loans, the interest is accrued immediately.   Basically Stafford loans are older loan types and direct loans are newer loan types.  Fellow Nelnet servicee here.  You said something about they just distribute based on what they say your monthly outstanding balance is; actually, you can pick which loan grouping you want to distribute to. Otherwise, they will fuck you and sometimes not align a much needed grouping into that particular month.  On the website, when you click pay this month or make a payment. On the next page, there will be a small gray or green button stating \"pay by grouping\".  At least by doing this you will be designating monies towards the larger ones and paying the interest on some of the others (if you choose) rather then letting them calculate out the automatic payment plan. At least that would save you potentially thousands, cause I know they won't calculate it up the best for you. Completely pay off Loan A, C, E, and G.  You will have paid 35,200.  Keep 1,000 in your checking/savings account for emergency situations and throw the rest of that 13,800 into Loan H.  Then just work the debt snowball method from then on.\n\n\n  You will have Loan H paid off in 4-6 months, then continue to tackle the smallest debt at a time.  B, F, and D.\n\nSince you will now only have 4 loans instead of 8 the additional payments you were making across the whole of each loan can now be focused. It really shouldn't matter the order. Personally I would use the 50k to get rid of the small loans completely and leave you with the larger ones. Then pay them off with largest minimum payment to smallest minimum payment. \n\nBy paying off the multiple small ones you're left with a couple fairly large ones, but instead of 8 minimum payments a month, you'll only have 3 or 4. Helpful if you fall on tough times. Pay the minimum on all except for one, and the one pay all you can afford.  Just curious, what did you go to school for, and what do you do now? How much are you making to drop 2250 on loans every month?  It sounds like you have a pretty good cash and income situation.  Would it be possible to consolidate these loans into one loan with a lower interest rate.   I have not had any experience but I have read about companies like earnest.com.  They work specifically with student loans and make their money on the quicker pay back as opposed to higher rate over time   Are you sure that those interest rates are correct? I think the only years that direct subsidized loans had a 6.8% rate was around 2006-8. What years were you in school? Unless you refinanced or consolidated some of your loans, I expect many of the subsidized ones to have a lower interest rate.  doctor? lawyer?

Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/personalfinance) if you have any questions or concerns.* Sounds like a perfect question for /r/studentloans, but I suppose many of us had or have them here. \n\nGraduated May 2011 with $34,500 in Federal loans. 99% were either Subsidized or Unsubsidized Stafford Loans with one Perkins loan. \n\nStarted with the standard 10 year repayment plan. Initial payment out of college was about $450/month once the Perkins hit (9 months postgrad instead of 6). Perkins was about 3.5% if I remember correctly, but it was the only loan at a provider (I had 3 separate loan providers upon graduation - Sallie Mae/Navient, MyGreatLakes, and whatever company had the Perkins). Staffords are 4.55-6.55% with 0.25% autopay rate decrease. \n\nCurrently down to just the Stafford loans at MyGreatLakes with $13.3k remaining. I throw lump sum amounts when I can afford to, now prioritizing the 6.55% loans. \n\nI'm also back in school for a second degree fully paying out of pocket. At first, my loan payments stopped for enrollment deferment and I let it go, but then I realized that wasn't ideal, so I resumed auto pay after 6-9 months and have been paying consistently since. Currently pay $240/month. \n\nIn a way, it hasn't really been a burden to me - just a monthly bill. However, I would be much more willing to rent a nicer place or even put some money towards a condo down payment if I didn't have the loan payment. \n\nThere are no \"gotchas\" just things to be aware of as an informed consumer. I did half my degree and took a semester off, so my loans already on auto pay were fine. However, re-enrolling at least half-time turned off the auto pay a second time, but I immediately turned it back on the moment the email came in. That's just standard treatment of federal loans, as far as I know. I don't think many people are in the position to pay out of pocket for tuition and keep paying their existing loan payments, but I'm fortunate enough to live in a cheap place that I can. \n\nI qualify for tuition reimbursement through work beginning in the fall, so once that happens, I'll be taking the $500-550/month I save for tuition currently and just add on to my loan payments, hopefully knocking them out quickly. Pretty sure the first year out of school almost solely went to interest, but now it's pretty minimal in comparison. My total 1098-E deductible interest on my taxes was ~$750. I graduated in May 2013 with a total of $24.5k in student loans. $10.5 were Parent PLUS loans with 7.9% that my mother had taken out in her name under the condition that I would be the one to pay them back. The rest were a mix of subsidized and unsubsidized Stafford loans at 3.4% and 6.8% interest. \n\nI was lucky enough to be able to move back home and live there for the next 3 years which helped me pay off the majority of the student loans. My monthly payments were about $140 for the Parent PLUS and $145 for the Stafford loans so overall not too bad. I had an internship right after graduating which later turned into a full-time position so I started repaying the loans back before the repayment period ever began (you normally have a 6 month grace period after graduating before you have to start making payments). At first I didn't focus too hard on paying off my student loans but in 2015 I started thinking about wanting to move out so I eliminated the Parent PLUS loans. I moved out last year and still have about $7k on the Stafford loans but I'm paid so much in ahead that I could stop making payments for the next 25 months and not be penalized (I won't do this though). And I get to deduct the interest paid on my student loans when I file my tax return. So overall not too bad but mostly because of the fact that my family let me live with them for so long. Otherwise it would have been much tougher.    Here is/was my breakdown (mine are paid off):\nAs background, my parents and i made a deal before college that they would help me pay afterwards. They split up and had money issues, so i ended up paying a bit more than half. \n\nThe monthly payments were around 400 i believe. One thing to note is that you can deduct student loan interest paid from taxes so that helps. \n\nOne thing to remember is to try to pay that interest down before it attaches, and if you have a chunk of money when you get out of college, you might want to make a large payment so that interest doesn't get out of hand. \n ", "date": 1483257600.0, "upvotes": 5, "flair": "Tell me about your student loans"}{"body": "So, last year I had a wisdom tooth extraction and my Dental Insurance, Assurant/Time, only paid a portion of they quoted to the surgeon.

You can do this for both 2016 and 2017.\n\n- You can open a SEP IRA based on your self employment.  You can contribute the $5,500 for *yourself/employee* but you cannot get a deduction because you are covered at work.  You can contribute up to a total of $53,000 (sum of Roth, traditional, 401(k), employer match) from *yourself/employer* and that may reduce your self-employment income, limit if 25%.  In your case, you earned $53,000 self employment, so you as the \"employer\" can contribute max $13,250 (probably lower if you have other business expenses) to your \"employee\" SEP IRA. In reality you are the same person, but the IRS treats it differently.\n\n- Your wife can contribute $5,500 to an IRA even though she has no personal income as long as you jointly have earned income.  She can put in $5,500 into her Roth, or $5,500 into a traditional.  The traditional may reduce joint income.  In your tax bracket I would consider the Roth (with no deduction) a better option.  YMMV. As always, [this](http://imgur.com/CcEVQAV) flowchart is amazing.\n\nI think in your situation you should be near the step where you increase your savings account to 3-6 months of expenses, and then look at maxing out a Roth IRA (that's $5500 per year, per person not sure if you are allowed to contribute for your wife because you have to earn as much as you contribute and she may(?) be considered as not having income).\n\nYou should start at the top of the flowchart though, and for the love of god if you don't have a detailed budget make one ASAP. When you subtract your monthly expenses from your monthly income, you should have a \"surplus\". This is the amount of money you will want to regularly invest in a combination of your 401k and other personal investment accounts.\n\nTo address your first goal, investments to a traditional 401k are not taxed upon contribution- but unfortunately it is too late for you to do this for 2016. If your goal is to reduce your current taxes, make sure that for 2017 you always contribute your budget surplus to your traditional 401k!\n\nA Roth IRA will require you to pay taxes on your income before you can contribute it, but then when you retire you will have access to your investment's growth *entirely tax free*. This is why people recommend maxing it every year.\n\nA personal investment account may not have tax advantages, but they are good because you can access all of the money at any age (unlike IRA's and 401k's where you have to reach a certain age). Try to look at large expenses coming up in your future greater than 3 years out (house purchase, kids' college expenses) and invest in a personal account to be able to afford those things.\n\nThat should just about address your second goal. Read the flowchart and make a budget!

If you're already paying term premiums think about converting or dropping that coverage. By overfunding a permanent contract that offers cash value growth you're looking at tax advantages that mimic a Roth IRA. Tax deductibility all depends on how your business is structured (C Corp, S Corp, etc), but a good financial advisor, CPA or insurance agent (or all three working together) should be able to point you in the right direction. \n\nBottom line is you should think about how you can leverage your business to minimize taxes. Also, ask yourself if you'd rather pay taxes now, or later when you're likely to have grown into a higher tax bracket.  \nYou have three options there: SEP IRA, Simple IRA and Solo 401k. An SEP IRA lets you put up to 25% of your net business profits in it. Simple IRA is up to $12,500 a year plus a 3% match for the 'company'. A 401k has the same limits as your existing one but you can opt for a 'company' match of up to 25%. \n\nYou can max out either the SEP IRA or Simple IRA while also maxing out your work 401k, however you can only contribute the max of $18,500 to any combination of 401k's. This makes a Solo 401k probably not as good as an SEP IRA or Simple IRA for you.\n\n[Vanguard has a calculator](https://personal.vanguard.com/us/SbsCalculatorController) that tells you roughly how much you can contribute to the various solo options. \n\nI believe (but don't quote me on this) that you can still open a Simple IRA or SEP IRA for 2016, but it's too late to open a solo 401k. I would give vanguard a call and ask them though (I am partial to them for self employed retirement accounts, but feel free to pick whoever). You can also contact your HR department and ask about making contributions to your 401k for 2016. This is allowed up until your tax filing deadline, however not all companies give a way to do that. \n\nMoving forward I would:\n\n- Max out company 401k @ $18,500 a year\n- Open up Simple IRA or SEP IRA and max out each year\n- Open up HSA (if you have a health plan with deductible > $1500) and max out each year ($3350, this can be invested through an administrator like HSA Bank)\n- Look into other IRA limits - you make too much to contribute to a roth IRA, but if you file jointly you should be under the limit if your wife has no income.

So, to counteract this, does the limit for Roth 401(k) instead apply to pre-tax contributions? For instance, if you contribute $18k pre-tax to a Roth 401(k), would taxes then be applied, so your Roth 401(k) balance would actually only maybe go up $12k if your marginal tax rate is 33%?

What happens is you contribute $18k and the government gets about $6k or so depending on your tax bracket as taxes. Wow, a lot of bad information in this thread. The 18k limit applies to *pre-tax* and *Roth* individual contributions combined. This is the amount that applies to what actually gets deposited in to your 401k plan, not its tax basis. For completeness, since perhaps you used the phrase *after-tax* contribution by mistake, the annual contribution limit for defined benefit plans is 54k. This includes employee and employer *pre-tax* and *Roth* contributions and *after-tax (Non-Roth)* contributions. Note that while most plans allow for Roth contributions, after-tax contributions are not as commonly allowed. There are some special tax considerations if your plan allows you to make after-tax contributions, like the ability to roll it directly in to a Roth IRA (Google Mega Backdoor Roth). You can contribute up to $18,000 to the Roth 401k. No taxes are taken out of the dollars put into the Roth 401k. You then pay income tax on your income including those $18000, but the taxes don't come out of your Roth 401k. >meaning you could sock away more money per year going with Roth vs. traditional 401(k). \n\nIt is indeed true that you can effectively save *more* in your Roth than a traditional account.

We recently (4yrs ago) purchased our \"forever home\" in a school district that we felt comfortable keeping our kids in. It's an 80s style 5br/3.5ba colonial with lots of updates.  The issue is our galley kitchen.  It's closed off and pretty outdated.  We're considering a $100K 200sq ft bump-out remodel that would really open up the space and make it more functional.  \n\nAs I said, our financial situation is pretty comfortable.  We've got $20k in savings, $6k in cc debt and a couple years left on a car note.  I'm an engineer and have a pretty stable job as a gov't contractor.  My wife teaches part time.  \n\nWe're looking at a 90%LTV HELOC or Equity Loan.  We could easily afford the interest only 10/1 HELOC, but I wonder if this is something we should even be considering. We could also afford a standard 20yr line of credit loan, but the budget would be a little tighter.  \n\nMy question is this.  Has anyone else been in a similar situation and made the decision one way or the other?  When we've talked to neighbors that have lived here since the homes were built, most of them have said that they wished they had bumped out the kitchen at the beginning.  \n\nOne other note here.  My parents gifted us $60k to help purchase the house when we had all three kids in pre-school ($$$).

In short, it had been going into the subfloor underneath the hardwood for a week.\n\nHe came today and confirmed that the planks needed to be replaced, and since they'd be different heights, he'd need to sand and polyurethane most of the place since I have continuous hardwood floor for it to look the same.

If this is a NEW house to you and is financed then your lender should have been all over you on providing the insurance info to them..a at time of closing.  Having said that trying to defraud the insurance will not end well.  If you are dealing with insurance coverage where there no local agents like GEICO and that type....where its all over the telephone, you are pretty much screwed.. Every Insurer in Illinois is required to carry an \"Errors and Omissions\" Policy for these instances. If you called them and to change your address and the representative did not correctly process this, then they are liable for their mistake. Essentially \"Errors and Omissions\" policies are insurance for insurance companies should they ever make a mistake. Failing to update an address or a car change is the most common \"E & O\" claim. \n\nMy questions are:\n\n1) Were you renting and then purchased a home?\n\n-If this is the case then calling your insurer to simply update your address would not be sufficient on your end. You would have needed to convert your Renters HO-4 policy into a Homeowners HO-3 or deluxe HO-5 depending on your property.\n\n-It is also the responsibility of your lender to make sure the property has insurance prior to closing and throughout the loan. They would have sent your company a request for a Certificate of Insurance and if they did not receive a response, your lender would have provided insurance through their own company at an increased premium.\n\n2) Were your premiums being paid on your policy?\n\n-Please tell me they were.\n\n3) Do you have an agent? \n\n-If you do then go to her office and say you want to file this against her Errors and Omissions. If you have a company that services their policies through a series of 1-800 numbers you are in for a more difficult time.\n\nFind out if your renters insurance was ever converted a homeowners. Your next step would be to contact the Illinois Director of Insurance and file a complaint against your company. \n\nDepending on your company you should be able to get this covered. Your company is probably just giving you the proverbial \"run-around\" because an \"E & O\" claim against them is subject to a deductible and a rate increase just as your personal lines are.\n\nSource: I am an Insurance agent in Illinois and work for one of the big two companies founded in Illinois I would keep pushing the issue with your insurance company.

As I understand it, the premium on these policies increases each year, at some point the premium paid each month will not cover the amount due.

Fellow mil here.  You can take your chances with TSP (thrift savings plan for the uninitiated), that might be the safest and surest way to guarantee some growth.  It's also convenient, and you can designate automatic contributions from your pay.  I'm not sure what your job is, but you don't want to worry about that kind of thing while you're on a ship or deployed.  Tax benefits are great too, if you can wait until retirement age.  Have you thought about which retirement plan you want (blended vs. traditional)?  If you're entering this year, you can choose.  I have to warn you, most officers who come in expecting to go the full 20 either leave or don't get up the ladder fast enough.  Anyway, that's TSP, it's a retirement tool, their website is great.  Another option for mil is USAA's investment service.  It's on their site, just log in and you can check it out under \"Accounts.\"  I haven't tried it myself.  Other options are all over this site.  But I agree with Default87: you're not going to find anything that safe and meets your goal of getting that much money from $6k/year plus bonuses, even with TIS and rank steps. Good luck! Investing in the stock market over a long term is very safe if you diversify your funds well. I would recommend investing in 3-4 different index funds. Index funds are like a stock in that you can purchase individual shares, but they are comprised of 20-30 individual stocks. \n\nTherefore indexes themselves provide diversification and a less time consuming way of investing in stocks. You can generally choose indexes based on the level of risk that you are comfortable in taking, also effecting the potential return.   Also consider that buying your home outright is not necessarily the most lucrative investment if interest rates remain low. \n\nImagine that $400k continuing to earn 7% while you borrow 400k with a VA loan for 4%.

It would appear to me that if the physical condition of the apartment is such that you need to permanently relocate, even to another property in your landlord's portfolio, your landlord is essentially in breach of contract from my understanding (and again, I'm not a lawyer, so take all this with a grain of salt). \n\nMy opening gambit would be to try to negotiate for the buyout *and* the discounted apartment, then reevaluate if that fails. this is a little TLDR and idk bay area rent regulation. but i do know the other big city's rent regs.  two thoughts. \n\n1. 'relocate while i do the repairs' is a common strategy.  while you're 'temporarily' relocated, something will come up and LL will start making excuses and hustling you and foot dragging until you just decide to move on voluntarily. \n\n2. if an LL offered $5k-8k in my town, i'd laugh my ass off. ten times that is still low to middle range here.  Are you in San Francisco? Just clarifying because other cities in the Bay Area have very different laws. The landlord has to provide alternate housing while there are repairs being done. This generally means a hotel in the city but you should ask one of the tenants rights groups. \n\nYou do not have to leave your apartment on short notice. Short a court order you do not have to leave. You need to speak to justa cause, the lrc, sftu, or another tenants rights group. Do not take advice from the internet. Do not move out to move into another apartment until you speak with a professional. If you move out voluntarily there is very little you can do to ensure your landlord keeps his promises. The landlord could be lying about the new unit being rent controlled, and then they could just not renew your lease or sharply raise your rent. Just because maintenance is being done does not mean that you have to move out, or that you would lose your tenancy. The rental rights groups will be the best source of information for how to demand the needed repairs with a minimal impact to your living situation. Basically if you do not agree to a buyout they can use the ellis act to evict you to perform repairs, but they have to pay you a relocation fee, and if the unit goes back on the market as a rental unit you have a right to occupy it at the original rate. More commonly though they will sell the apartment as a condo and the whole process is overly complicated and changes every couple of years.

Anyone in California Los Angeles...if you're single 30's and unemployed but withdraw 15K from your traditional ira are you only responsible for paying the 10%penalty and no state or fed tax? \n\nThere's something for california residents about under $16,500 single you are exempt from state tax, correct? What about fed, are you only allowed up to $10,350 from deductions and have to pay fed tax for the remaining $4,650 (based on withdrawing $15k from the ira)?  Random question regarding 529 plans. I was on scholarships through undergrad and grad school tuition is covered by TA/RA gigs. I have a 529 plan set up, say for ease of math: 40k principal, 10k earnings. If I make withdrawals to cover qualified expenses (room and board), there's no penalty or tax. But say I only have 3 semesters left of grad school, and the max I can withdraw for those qualified expenses is 25k. \n\nIf I withdraw that last 25k a while after I graduate, how much am I on the hook for wrt penalty/tax since it'll be a non-qualified withdrawal? Cases I can think of would be:\n\n* the remaining 25k is of the principal, so no penalty/tax.\n* there's 15k of the principal and 10k of the earnings, so 1k penalty and tax based on my bracket at the time of withdrawal\n* withdrawals go by the ratio of principal to earnings. So 20k principal left, 5k earnings left. $500 penalty and associated taxes.\n\nThoughts? Anything I might be missing or watch out for regarding the above plan for withdrawals? Hi guys!

I'm part of a union and our collective bargaining agreement recently was approved with a $2/hr increase.

My former job did offer it but I only had it for one month before I left that job and started this one. TurboTax is telling me I will have to pay $430 in taxes because I didn't have health insurance, even though there's really no way I can have it. Anything I can do?  I once read when I pay off my loan it will initially drop my credit score. Is this true? About how much? My credit isn't great(740) and a drop would really not be good for me. I would think paying off a debt would do the opposite and raise my score, especially since I am paying my car off two years early.\n\nInsight appreciated This is really a question for my aunt. Her credit score is around 550 right now. She has a credit one card. I took over her finances and I'm trying to save her some money/get rid of that terrible card. I just added her as an AU(with no physical card) on three of my cards to lower her utilization with the goal of getting it to the 700s for the citi double cash(it's the easiest IMO for her). Would she have a shot at getting approved if she climbs up to 700s with an auto loan and $96 in collections? I'm just getting into saving for retirement. I have the options of 401(k), 457(b), and IRA from my employer. In what order should I be contributing to those accounts? I don't receive employer contributions for any of them. Thank you so much. While trying to get my free annual credit report I came across a possible identity theft done to me. On the verification they asked who was the bank that backed a car loan and a mortgage. All the questions were about the two; the other questions being about monthly payments for the same loans.\n\nNow, I have done the manual method of identity verification to the credit reporting bureaus and await their answer. I sent that stuff almost 3 weeks back to the three major ones and karma decay.\n\nWhile I wait for them to approve and provide me with the reports, is there anything I can do to prepare for if it turns out to be a case of stolen identity? What are the chances of it being wrong given that it pulled all that up after giving my SS number in the application process?\n\nThanks. Want to give my car to my brother. He is in college.

It's quite a long ways away but I'm already getting nervous about the financial nitty gritty of e relocation.\n I have a question about the fine for not having health insurance. My sister had health insurance all last year except for December. (She started a new job in January so is now insured again.) I told her if it was me I would just say you were insured all year when filing taxes so you don't get fined. It was only one month uninsured. But my question is does the IRS have any way to know the exact period of time you were insured? And/or would there be any reason for them to actually verify this? Just wondering if I gave her bad advice. I told her the worst thing that could happen is you might get a bill later from the IRS for incorrect filing (with a small late fee attached). Best case scenario is they don't notice or care. Thoughts?  W-2 Question.  I quit my previous job back in January 2016.  Got cashed out. My gross last pay was about $6k because it included vacation and sick pay I had saved up.  I received about $3.k and the rest were taken out as taxes.  \n\nThe other day I received my W-2 and it only shows about $1.2k taken out in taxes for the entire time of 2016.  That doesn't seem correct to me.  Is it because the vacation time was taxed as 2015 income maybe? or is that normal when getting cashed out from leaving a job?   Hey, guys.

You can't just randomly say you only want to include part of it. You owe taxes on all income you guys made. When you file jointly, both you and your spouse must report all income from all sources unless there is a law that specifically exempts that income.  You have to report all income whether or not you receive a W-2, 1099, or other document.\n\nIf you file separately, you still must report all income, just do it separately.  Your wife makes enough income to be required to file, whether you file jointly or separately.\n\nIf you don't mind my saying, your question seems unusual.  Did you have a specific concern about filing?  For example, you know that you file just one tax return and list all your jobs added together on that tax return.  You don't have to file a separate tax return for each job.\n Additionally I made around $35,000 and 2,800 from two different jobs last year, how will that impact us? So totals:\n\nMe job 1: $35,000\nMe job 2: $2,800\nWife job 1: $25,000\nWife job 2: $3,800\n\nApproximate total:$66,000.\n\nI ask because for her job with 3,800 she did not have taxes withdrawn and it dropped our tax return, however I did have taxes withdrawn for my job with 2,800. For both other jobs we had taxes withdrawn. You have to include all four incomes, even though only three of the incomes had taxes being taken out from them during the year. Indeed, the fact that the fourth income stream did not have taxes taken out, is going to very likely cause you to owe some tax that is unpaid as yet.\n\n>I was doing a dry run through Turbotax and got excited at a larger return and then I input her return and watched it drop quite a bit. ...\n\nThe \"refund\" value you see in software while you are in the process of entering your income and your withheld amounts is not accurate until after you have entered all your income and all your withheld amounts. Do not pay any attention to those \"interim\" values, as they are inaccurate since your actual tax depends on the sum of all your incomes.\n\nYou can try entering your W-2s in different orders, and you'll still see these sorts of \"fake\" drops in refund. \n\nIf your wife's other job did not have taxes taken out [edit: if it is being reported on a 1099], IRS will treat this as self-employment income, and your tax software should enter her income on a Schedule C. Because not only income taxes but also Social Security and Medicare taxes were due on this income, that will get calculated. You will see that the income ends up as part of line 12, and the tax related to Social Security and Medicare will end up on line 57 of Form 1040. This may explain why there was more liability than you expected -- because self-employed people pay about 14.1% of their profit to Soc Security and Medicare, whereas W-2 employees pay about 7.65%. all income is taxable in your case\n An example shows why you might see refund \"drop\" just by entering your 35000 and 25000 W-2s. Suppose you had 2000 and 500 withheld from those. All the items in \"scare quotes\" below are inauthentic.\n\nIf you enter 35000 W-2 alone:\n\n\"income\" = 35000  \ndeduction/exemptions = 20700  \n\"taxable income\" = 14300  \n\"tax\" = 1433  \nwithholding = 2000  \n\"refund\" = 567\n\n\nIf you enter the 25000 W-2 alone:\n\n\"income\" = 25000  \ndeduction/exemptions = 20700  \n\"taxable income\" = 4300  \n\"tax\" = 433  \nwithholding = 500  \n\"refund\" = 67\n\nEither W-2 by itself seems to have a refund. But your actual tax is a lot higher, because you only get to use the 20700 deduction and exemption once, so your real taxable income is much higher than the sum of the taxable incomes described above.\n\nIn reality:\n\nincome = 35000 + 25000 = 60000  \ndeduction/exemptions = 20700  \ntaxable income = 39300  \ntax = 4971  \nwithholding = 2000 + 500 = 2500  \ntax still owed = 2471\n\nYou'd still owe 2471, instead of getting a refund, in this invented example. So if you enter W-2 #1 then W-2 #2, you see your \"refund\" drop from 567 to owing 2471. If you enter W-2 #2 then W-2 #1, you see your \"refund\" drop from 67 to owing 2471.

Of course you can, you just have to be on the right side of the fence. If tomorrow would be a start of a huge crisis, it wouldn't be a problem for me IF I recognized it at an early stage. Once I have a good recognition of either a bull or a bear trend, place a position on the direction either long or short, and it proves, then I'm making dough.\n\nYou seem to be just handwaving away the issue of recognizing a market crisis early.\n\nFurther, how would compare the risk of shorting a stock to buying a stock?\n Yes it is easy to make gains in up markets, don't quit your day job yet until you can make money in a down cycle. For the specific assets you're trading, are there any good barometers for understanding what the gains were attributed to compared to your logic for trading? For example, did you decide that you disagreed with the market's expectation of growth based on the price you purchased, and in fact your own growth projections panned out? If you dont have a sense of why you're performing well, it could very well be a sign of luck. My 401k invested in index funds has done about 25% from Jan 25, 2016 through Jan 25, 2017 when I looked and rebalanced for the year. It's not hard to pick winners in a bull market.  That's great! The market has been surging over the course of the last year. I would look at your choices and evaluate if your decision was based off of careful analysis of individual companies and the market which proved to be true or if it was really just guessing and luck.\n\nObviously some people can make large amounts of money from playing the market like warren Buffett, but that is based off of careful financial analysis and a little bit of luck rather than a hunch and a lot of luck.

I don't have too much wiggle room with the additional $1000 for rent.   \n>   \n> What are my options/best course of action for what to do? Should I go into a 5 year buy out loan?

Contact) ^[pentium4borg](https://www.reddit.com/user/pentium4borg) ^(with any feedback.) 13-15K for a 2014 Accord with 65,000 miles is a total ripoff.  That car would maybe be worth 9-10K.  \n\nA five year loan on 15,000 will be over your 200/month limit.  That will come in closer to 300 a month.  Plus you would immediately be upside down on that car so you would need gap insurance.  \n\nI would tell car max you are done in April when the lease term ends, and look for a similar vehicle to purchase used for around 9000-11000.  You put 1000 down from your savings, get a four year loan, and you'll end up paying around $200 a month.  Probably get into a similar vehicle too.\n\nMaybe you can save a little more between now and April?  Hold onto your refund?

A CD or just a high interest savings account will be fine. Several banks pay 1% or slightly more on savings: Goldman Sachs, Ally, Capital One 360, Barclays, Synchrony Another option is to put the money into a Roth IRA. She can contribute $5500 for 2016 and $5500 for 2017. Nominally this is a retirement account, but she can invest it in whatever she likes inside of that account - including CD's. Perhaps she puts half or 2/3 of it in a CD and half or 1/3 of it in an Index fund. She could treat this as a long-term retirement fund where it is locked away (which would be a good habit to start), but she would be allowed to withdraw her contributions at any time without penalty if she really needed the money in an emergency. \n\nThis gets her started with something that's good for her to have for her future, without tying her hands completely. What does she want to save for? Is she is saving for a car or a wedding? If yes, then a CD would be a good idea because it's safe. But if she has a long term goal in mind like retirement, then CDs would be a TERRIBLE IDEA. 1.38% is dog crap compared to what she could get with an index fund. We're talking like 8%. Hell, even if the market is terrible one year and only gets 4%, she's still doing a lot better than a CD.\n\nAgain, it depends on her goals. For definite short term goals (down payment on a house, etc.), go for a CD. But if she is saving just to save, put the money to good use and invest it in the market.

I went to my orders on Amazon and looked at all the invoices, and it says the price of the item and under that it says \"Sales tax\" and whatever amount the sales tax is.

When I first got insurance, I was told that the high deductible plan is for people who never get sick. I get sick constantly and am frequently in and out of the doctors' office, so I ignored any plan that advertised itself that way. Now that I'm looking at a PDF of all the plans my insurance provider offers, it looks like this plan is a dream for people who are sick frequently. It's possible I'm looking at it wrong, but I'm asking on here because I'm interested in some answers. I'm in a low income situation and am receiving government aid for food and health insurance, which I've factored in below. \n\n**My current plan:**           \nPremium: $215/month       \nDeductible: $2,200         \nOut of Pocket Max: $6,000           \nDoctor visits are covered, specialist visits are covered, therapist visits are covered. Lab work, medication, and any kind of tests are not covered until deductible is met. I was recently billed over a thousand dollars for lab work I didn't even know they were doing, when I called the insurance company they said it's not covered until I hit my deductible. My own fault for not reading the fine print, but that's what started me on this path.          \n\n**High Deductible Plan I'm Looking At:**             \nPremium: $255/month          \nDeductible: $2500         \nOut of Pocket Max: $2500         \nNothing is covered until deductible/OOPM is met, then everything is covered.         \n\nThere are several other lower deductible plans that look better on paper than the high deductible one I've listed, but will be $350-450/month even after financial assistance. \n\nThe way I see it, I could put ~$2500 into the HSA that comes with the account every year (that's around $48 per paycheck), use that to pay off the deductible at the beginning of the next year, and then everything after that should be covered.

From what you describe that's the HDHP.\n\nThe only shock with the HDHP is you're paying the full negotiated cost of each health event as it happens, and that *feels* painful even if over the course of the year you will save money.  So each visit to the doc will cost you maybe $150, prescriptions will cost you anything from $5 to $100s, depending on what you need, same with blood tests... all until you reach the OoPMax.\n\nIf your employer allows you to contribute to your HSA through payroll the contribution is tax free and payroll tax free, so you save even more doing it that way than if you make a manual contribution and wait until your tax return to get the benefit.  If you have any expenses early in the year before your HSA has enough in it, you can just pay normally, keep the receipts and refund yourself later in the year when the HSA is full.  The rule is the HSA must be established before the medical event happens to be used to pay for it, it doesn't have to have funds in it yet.\n\nAlso if it's a self-only plan (not family plan) the maximum you can put in an HSA for 2017 is $3350, so you can put more than the $2500 deductible if you wish.

You might visit your local library, see what books about investing they have got.\n The safest way is to buy 100 shares of a company and sell covered options on the stock you own. That way, you can't lose more than the premium on those shares. \n\nFor example. Buy 100 shares of Company A at 10 dollars each.  Sell options that specify that the buyer will pay you .50 cents per share (50 dollars) for the opportunity to buy the shares at 11 dollars per share if they want to at specified time. They would do that in the hopes that the stock went to 13 dollars and they would be able to have the locked in price of 11.

If your AGI is over $80k, no deduction for you. yep.   student loan interest deduction maxes at 2500/yr.  plus it phases out.  completely worthless for those who use their degrees.     \n  \nTEXT BELOW\n  \nhttps://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc456.html  \n  \nTopic 456 - Student Loan Interest Deduction\nStudent loan interest is interest you paid during the year on a qualified student loan. It includes both required and voluntarily pre-paid interest payments. You may deduct the lesser of $2,500 or the amount of interest you actually paid during the year. The deduction is gradually reduced and eventually eliminated by phaseout when your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) amount reaches the annual limit for your filing status. \nYou claim this deduction as an adjustment to income, so you don't need to itemize your deductions on Form 1040, Schedule A (PDF), Itemized Deductions. \nYou can claim the deduction if all of the following apply: \nYou paid interest on a qualified student loan in tax year 2016;\nYou're legally obligated to pay interest on a qualified student loan; \nYour filing status isn't married filing separately;\nYour MAGI is less than a specified amount which is set annually; and \nYou or your spouse, if filing jointly, can't be claimed as dependents on someone else's return. \n\nA qualified student loan is a loan you took out solely to pay qualified higher education expenses that were: \nFor you, your spouse, or a person who was your dependent when you took out the loan; \nFor education provided during an academic period for an eligible student; and \nPaid or incurred within a reasonable period of time before or after you took out the loan. \n\nSee Publication 970, Tax Benefits for Education, and the Form 1040 Instructions to determine if your expenses qualify. \nIf you file a Form 2555 (PDF), Foreign Earned Income, Form 2555-EZ (PDF), Foreign Earned Income Exclusion, or Form 4563 (PDF), Exclusion of Income for Bona Fide Residents of American Samoa, or if you exclude income from sources inside Puerto Rico, refer to Worksheet 4-1, Student Loan Interest Deduction Worksheet in Publication 970, instead of the worksheet in the Form 1040 Instructions. \nIf you paid $600 or more of interest on a qualified student loan during the year, you'll receive a Form 1098-E (PDF), Student Loan Interest Statement, from the entity to which you paid the student loan interest. \nFor more information about the student loan interest deduction and how your MAGI affects the deduction amount, refer to Publication 970, and Can I Claim a Deduction for Student Loan Interest? There's two things you're missing:\n\n1) How much you paid in your student loans is irrelevant. The deduction is on the interest you were charged, not on your payments on principal (and it also maxes out, as others pointed out).\n\n2) If you work two jobs you'll almost certainly under-withhold unless you calculate things very carefully. Each job will withhold assuming that's your only job, so it won't be enough (since the tax liability in $2X income is quite a bit more than twice the liability on $X income).  > Am I missing something?\n\nIt seems you are missing how taxes work.\n\nWhether you owe when you file your return will depend on the difference between your tax *liability* and your tax *withholding*. \n\nIf you had more withheld than you were liable for, you would get a refund.\n\nIf you had a higher tax liability than the amount you had withheld, then you would owe money, like you do now.\n\nSince you don't include your total withholding for federal and state, I am assuming you did not realize this. Refunds are not magic money. They are the return of money that was yours all along - which is they are called *refunds*. \n\nYou could have much more withheld throughout the year and then have the IRS refund that to you if you desire a larger refund. Or, you could do as you did for the federal income taxes and have just the right amount of withholding happen so that you keep more money in your pocket throughout the year. That is the path most at r/personalfinance would recommend, unless you have self-control issues and a refund is your form of forced savings, which would be fine. Something tells me there is no way you payed 20,000 dollars worth of interest on a loan in one year.

This past year my cost for college went up. (my dad started making more money so I will be getting less financial aid, unfortunately due to large family size my dads  pay raise is not going to translate into being able to contribute to my tuition) Whereas previously my tuition was covered through a combination of scholarships, grants and federal loans, there is now an extra 2k a semester that I will either have to pay out of pocket, or get in loans.\n\nA couple weeks ago, I found out that my dad apparently started a ROTH IRA account for me about 10 years ago, and there is currently about 8k in the account. From what I can tell, if I chose to I could withdraw the majority of this money relatively tax free. So my question is, should I just leave that account untouched until I graduate/get a job, when I would start investing into it and take on more students loans to cover my current tuition costs, or use the 8k to cover the extra cost of my tuition for my final three semesters?\n\nWhile I'm trying to not be too optimistic, I can say that I've worked hard at making sure I have been doing internships, and building connections so at this point it looks like getting a job right out of college shouldn't be too unrealistic. My goal is to pay off all my student loans within the first 3 years of graduating, at which that point I will more than likely be proposing to my current S/O of 3 years (I know that sounds cliche and youthfully optimistic). \n\nLike I said earlier, I am currently financing my education without the help of my parents, and am also working a part time job. So should I use that money now? or bite the bullet, take a little more debt, and let it sit in the account? Hopefully my post/question was clear.", "title": "20y old college student, just found out I have a ROTH IRA account with 8k in it, started years ago by my father, unsure what to do.", "comments": "I suppose this is part advice, part question for other subscribers?\n\nI was under the impression that you cannot start or contribute to other peoples' Roth IRA accounts? A Roth IRA is a personal account which you can only have one of, and can only contribute to *from your income*. You should confirm that this account is in fact a \"Roth IRA\", before you decide what to do. You need to get clarification of what this Roth IRA is. If it's in you name and you didn't have the earned income to qualify you are in for a big tax bill. \n\nIf it is in your name and you did have the earned income to qualify for it, pulling any contributions from it will have to be reported as income and will increase the expected family contribution by 50% of that amount next year. So if you pull $6k from the account this year, then next year you may lose up to $3k of your financial aid. \n\nFirst, you need to clarify the ownership specifics of this account. Second, if you were to decide this was how you want to use the money, wait until you are a senior to use it because then it can't count against your financial aid. Are your current federal loans accruing interest?\n\nAre the loans you would take out for the extra $2k/semester going to accrue interest while you are in school?\n\nHow much total in loans do you owe right now?\n\nMy thinking is that if your loans are not accruing interest right now, why not keep the Roth intact and try to work a bit more to defer costs.  If interest does not accrue, the loan is basically \"free\" until you graduate.  You could re-assess then and determine whether or not to pay off the loans.\n\nThe optimist in me really thinks it'd be easy to earn an extra $4k/year doing side jobs like shoveling snow, waiting tables or mowing lawns in the summer. That way, you could leave it intact or even use it to pay off your current loans without adding more debt.  And the pessimist in me is concerned you would cash it out, overspend and end up with more debt anyway.\n\nIf you are already accruing interest on the loans, depending on the rate, I would lean towards cashing it out.  But there are a lot of moving parts to a decision like this, so think it through and don't rush into it. $8K would cover the remaining 4 semesters with the tuition increase. You could Uber when you turn 21. In the mean time you just need to decide if the potential return on your investment is higher or lower than the accruing interest on an unsubsidized loan while you are in college. I would tap the bare minimum in the IRA to pay this semester and hopefully you will have more saved from whatever gig you pick up to pay your way through the rest of school assuming your parents can't/won't help more later.

Filling this out is also the way to avoid the tax penalty if you can't afford coverage. They gave me a letter to attach to my taxes saying I wasn't being charged the tax penalty.  I make too much money to qualify for a subsidy and the cheapest policy I can get through my state exchange is $1732 per month with an $8000 deductible.

No thank you.  \n\nEdit:  For the past 2 years I have been able to find healthcare plans for about $100/month from the healthcare marketplace.  My job and income level has not changed, nor have I had any health concerns.  I'm truly not sure why the cost increased so much for me this year.  The worst part of all of this is the commercials they show on TV. \"Most people that sign up thro8gh healthcare.gov receive a subsidy to help pay their premiums\" with happy music. People dancing and laughing as they show $590, $780, $490 crossed out with ridiculously low numbers highlighted. God i hate that commercial. Everytime I yell at the TV. \"BUT WHAT IF WE ARENT MOST PEOPLE. JUST FUCK US I GUESS\". the good news is, i was able to keep our premiums the same as last year.

I started out college with 8 calculus credits from high school, was awarded the first ever full-ride merit scholarship from this particular school, and so far have maintained a 3.9 GPA. My dream is to attend an out of state school to finish up my Mechanical Engineering degree. I am confident that this is what I want to do, I am not so confident in the timing.\n\nMy issue: I could attend one of two great in-state schools for engineering, namely PITT or Penn State, or I could go to my dream school, CU Boulder. I would love to attend Boulder, but out of state costs will put me close to $50K per year. I really want to minimize my future debt.\n\nBasically I see 3 options for my future self.\n\n1. Forget my dream school and go to college in-state. I would rather not do this, as I am ready for something new in my life. I would love to move somewhere totally new where nobody will recognize me so that I have a chance to start with a completely clean slate. This will clearly save me money, however. I believe it will also make it much harder for me to move my life elsewhere after school.\n\n2. Pay out-of-state costs for 1-1.5 years in CO and take on the debt. I will work to get the in-state tuition by sometime during my second year, but I will graduate on time and have a good-paying job sooner rather than later.\n\n3. Live and work in CO for a year to establish residency and make college cheaper. I think I would learn a lot in my year off and take the time to figure out what is really important to me, but I'm curious as to how this would affect me financially. \n\nWould going with option 3 rather than 2 really save me that much money in the end since it's a year without an engineer's salary? I'm stuck and I have no idea what my next move should be.

I am not biased at all because its my profession.\n\nI would not go into debt for out of state tuition, so for me its either 1 or 3 (assuming you can support yourself with 3).\n\nBut I think you may be overlooking an option.  Have you considered a work/study co-op?  Engineering interns get good money (I got $15/hr 10 years ago, in rural GA).  Many schools have work/study programs where you go co-op at a company for a semester and then come back for the next semester.  Keep doing that until you graduate.  It does make school take longer, but you get paid while doing it, gain valuable work experience, and lower your overall costs.\n\nI would ask either the school you are at or the school you want to attend if you are eligible for a program like this.\n\nAdditionally, is $50k/year the total cost of attendance before or after scholarships and such?  If you got a merit based scholarship before, there is no reason you couldn't get one at these bigger schools.\n\nAnd, finally, all you really need is an ABET accredited school.  That's all employers are looking for.  It, generally, does not matter where you graduated as long as its ABET accredited.  I would not attend a larger school and go into debt.  Instead, move to Colorado (or wherever) and see if there's a smaller, cheaper school that is also ABET accredited.  Taking your time in college is absolutely fine and I actually highly recommend it. You are going to work the next 40 years living your life for weekends and your 3 weeks vacation. Don't be in such a hurry, take your time. Enjoy yourself while you are young, the workforce will still be there waiting for you.  I wish I did it back in the day. \n\nIf you haven't already done so be 100% sure about the residency requirements for out of state school.  Most states are more diligent now about this and they have stricter rules to prevent people from doing exactly what you are describing. \n\nIf you can't get in state tuition in CO then I would not go into debt just to go there.  Debt can be crippling to young people starting out and you will be very thankful in years to come if you've minimized your debt.

To spare you the details of how I found out, it's definitely not a scam. I've been in contact with the Senior Account Executive from Interstate (based here in Dallas) and I should be getting the truck next week. My question is this: should I sell the truck and pay off some debt, save some, and maybe spend a little to celebrate? Or keep the truck? I have the feeling the answer will be to sell it because honestly I don't have a lot of use for a truck, but it's not every day that you're given a brand new vehicle. The MSRP on the truck I picked out at a local dealership is $39,000 before rebates, and if we can finalize the sale before the end of the month, it will be around $35,000 after rebates (tax, title, license, fees included). I know I wouldn't get that much for it if I sold it, but I'm just curious what you guys think. The debts that my wife and I currently have are as follows:\n\n* Wife's car loan - $11,000 \n* Credit card debt - ~$6,000\n* Recent medical bills - ~$4,500\n\nTotal: ~$21,500 (not including student loan debt which is collectively over $80K)\n\nWe only make around $35,000 a year, so selling the truck makes more sense to me. My current vehicle is kind of junky, so I'd be trading that in with the truck. If I sell the truck, then I'd obviously have to buy a used car, so I'm willing to take advice in that area as well. Thanks for reading!\n\nEdit: I should add that my wife makes $25K with a good chance of getting a job reclassification this year and making more like $35-$40K. I'm working part time while finishing my IT degree and bring in ~$10K but there's a chance that I'll get a full time position in the IT department this Fall (around $40K per year).

In 3 years, I have spent $7000 on gas alone driving 38k miles.  Oil change is more, replacing all 4 tires is going to be over $1000, insurance is more, license plate is more (Depends on state)  Parking is a pain in cities (I don't live in a city but when I visit one, it's a pain).  With gas being $2/gallon, it's not as painful now but when it was hovering $4/gallon, every fill up was about $80~100.  I had to fill up weekly since I was driving a lot more back then.\n\nI also have a compact work car I do most of the driving and the cost of driving is about half of the truck if not lower. Do they give you the option of taking a cash prize in lieu of the truck? I came in here knowing everyone would say sell it, and I wanted to be the guy to say not to, because of the loss in value and the fact that it's cool af to drive a truck that you *won*\n\nbut you're not making enough to keep it or probably pay the insurance. \n\nsucks, but it's gotta go. if you want to try to keep it, I support ya, but the wise thing to do is sell it. Dude, sell that heaving hump of of steel, pay off your wife's car, cc, and medical, and buy yourself a brand spanking new Honda Fit that will last you 15-20 years easy. I would sell it. Getting rid of the current debt would really help out, especially if it's high interest (which I assume the CC and car loan are). Getting rid of that debt and the associated interest payments will give you much more money in the long run. And if you and/or your wife see a big increase in income soon your monthly cash flow will be much higher. Save and get something you want.\n\nLike you said, you don't have much use for a truck.

You're giving up *enormous* tax advantages by foregoing the 529 options and while college may not be necessary, some form of post-high school education most certainly is *if* your goal is to avoid poverty.  Things are getting harder for those without education, not easier, and dropping a lump sum of cash in a kid's lap when they're 18 is a recipe for disaster. If you're stuck in this mentality, I'd put 100% of the money into a simple index fund - something like VTI (total stock market) and leave it alone.\n\n> She is VERY reserved about using stock market and wants something \"safe\"-ish. \n\nNo she doesn't.  She isn't interested in a safe investment because her current investment strategy is guaranteed to lose money every single year.  Inflation rates change, but its hovered around 2.1% for some time.  you're throwing away at least 1% of your money every year it sits there.  You're investing for about 20 years.  [When looking at the S&P 500 over a 20 year time span, there is only 1 20 year time frame where an investment made on day 1 was worth less in \"real\" terms on year 20](http://observationsandnotes.blogspot.com/2009/04/best-worst-20-years-in-stock-market.html).  Average returns are about 10% a year.  Would you view an investment guaranteed to lose 8.9% a year as safe?  If not, why are you investing in an investment that historically loses out to the S&P 500? To be honest, the best way to save for your children is to be in a financially sound position yourself. There's not really much advantage to pre-gifting this kind of gift (unless it is going to be so enormous of a gift that you need to worry about estate planning and taxes).\n\nOnce your children are old enough to learn about money and savings, give them an allowance and teach them how to use a chequing or savings account: most banks should offer a free interest-bearing account for children. When they get their first paying jobs in high school, encourage them to save a large percentage of their earnings. Teach them about the stock market and personal finance and how to do their taxes, because they won't learn about that in school.\n\nOnce they are 18 (or whatever age you feel is appropriate, based on actually knowing their maturity level as young adults, not as babies), then it's time to hit them with your big gift. If you are risk averse, then CD's or money market accounts are basically the only way to go. I would keep it in your account. They can always inherit your assets.\n\nHere are some reasons why I wouldn't give it to them:\n1.) They might treat it as found money and spend it all.\n2.) They could get divorced and half of it would be gone. \n3.) Make them earn their money. Don't give it to them. Having it will give them less incentive to work. \n\nSince your wife is a very conservative investor and will most likely invest only in CDs, put the money in a retirement account where it accumulates tax free. Please listen to the other advice here. Saving for your kids sounds good in theory. In practice it is a much better option to maximize your own retirement savings which allows you to save much more money (due to the tax advantages of these accounts), and gives you *and* your children the piece of mind that you will have enough money to take care of yourselves in old age. It is *much* easier for your kids to earn their own money during their lives and to work and take loans to pay for college than to feel responsible for helping you in retirement.\n\nPlease also take the advice about inflation. Even CD's won't keep up with inflation over time. Your reserve about using the market in lieu of something 'safe-ish' could actually cause you to lose money over time. If the market isn't what you want, and you decide to continue saving this money separate of your own accounts, then consider government bonds like i-bonds, or TIPS which are guaranteed not to lose principle to inflation.

That's way more than an emergency fund would ever need to be.  It can't be risk aversion, since you're heavily invested in personal stocks and those are incredibly risky.  \n\nIf the choice is between continuing to contribute $2k/month to a fund that doesn't keep pace with inflation and shrinks in real purchasing power with every passing day *or* to pay off the house, I'd contend that you ought to pay off the house.  \n\nI am surprised that you're not both maxing out your 401(k)s and I'm stunned that you're not maxing out Roth IRAs.  \n\nAs a final comment - a tax write off isn't always a good thing.  Paying a bank $1 in interest to avoid paying 33 cents in tax makes little sense.  I wouldn't keep a mortgage alive simply because of the deduction. Is the 2k/mo what's remaining in your budget after expenses?  I'd look into maxing out the 401k and what does your IRA situation look like as well as shifting anything over 6 months of expenses from your MMA into either index funds (such as SPY) or mutual funds.\n\nWhat is your employer match/vesting period?  Are you worried about leaving before the vesting period?  What funds are available in your 401k, i.e. low fee funds?  The reason I ask is that if your funds available are poor-performing or running high cost fees I'd look into maxing out an IRA for each of you (roughly $1000/mo for both of you if you were to start now) with Vanguard or similar that have good performance histories and low fees.  What is your employer match, if any?\n\nI don't see a reason to shift more towards the mortgage paying it at the 15 year rate if not slightly higher is great and will let you be mortgage free easily by retirement whether you stay in the house or move.

For some reason I was thinking you could get about $250k for that amount, but its been awhile since I compared prices.\n\nAs for the amount, don't use rules of thumb.  Calculate how much your family would need to live on if you were to die.   If your income were to disappear today, how much would your family need to continue to live in the sytyle they are accustomed to (or better).....and how long would you want the life insurance to supplement them.\n\nSome folks go bare minimum, enough to pay off debts and have about a year's worth of money left (figuring the remaining spouse would need to adjust and change their lifestyle).  Some over insure and go for enough to pay off all debt and replace their salary and replace their spouse's salary so that the spouse can quit work and stay at home and mourn (or move to the beach to mourn).  Likely somewhere in the middle is where most people fall.\n\nI chose to do enough to pay off debt and fully fund college savings plus a bit extra.  With debt gone and college accounted for, my family would easily be able to live off my spouse's salary, and my spouse would easily be able to continue to save for retirement. Typically it is recommended to get 10-12 times your annual salary in a level term policy, so the $100k might be a little thin (don't forget to include any life insurance that your job provides in the calculation).  For what its worth, my policy is worth $1 million and I pay $34/month. That rate seems high for fairly limited coverage. Before anyone asks, Protective is the insuring company.  Getting life insurance is a great idea even if you're young but you have to shop around. I pay about $14.00 a month for 300k in life insurance (term 20 years).

Negating the benefit of said warranty? etc etc etc.  Anybody have a rule of thumb for determining when it's \"worth it?\"", "title": "Extended Warranties - Always a Ripoff? Even if you drive 30,000 miles a year?", "comments": "It depends on the price, but no, extended warranties are generally not worthwhile. The problem is that you rarely get a benefit immediately and you usually end up financing the cost of the warranty, increasing its cost. \n\nThe first thing preventing you from getting an immediate benefit from the extended warranty is the manufacturer's warranty. Let's say you buy a car that has 20k miles on it now and has a 60k manufacturer powertrain warranty. You buy an extended powertrain warranty out to 100k miles. \n\nFor the first 40k miles you own the car, the manufacturer warranty covers any powertain part that breaks on the car. So, for the first 40k miles, the extended warranty has absolutely no value. \n\nWhen the car hits 60k miles, you lose the manufacturer powertrain warranty. From 60k to 100k miles, you could receive a benefit under the extended warranty. Your \"100k mile\" extended warranty is really only good for 40k miles worth of driving. At 30k miles a year, it will be 16 months (40k miles) before you are eligible to receive any benefit under the extended warranty. \n\nThe second thing preventing you from getting an immediate benefit from an extended warranty is the fact that your car is much less likely to break at the beginning of the warranty period than at the end. Most cars go 100k miles no problem. The ones that do break usually break closer to 100k miles than 60k. If you drive 30k miles/year and your car breaks at 90k miles, you've waited 28 months - more than two years - to receive any benefit from the extended warranty.\n\nThe third thing that prevents the warranty from being worthwhile is the financing. A $2,000 warranty financed over 60 months at 4% really costs $2,210. That's about a 10% increase. \n\nThe fourth thing is the cost of the warranty compared to the cost of the repairs you are likely to need. Most repairs probably aren't going to cost more than you paid for the warranty. You're going to need to buy a car that either breaks down catastrophically or breaks down more than once to get a benefit from the warranty.  For me it was. I used mine 4 times and the cost for repairs was around 4.5k and I paid 2k for the warranty. Though sometimes you won't even use it.  It's technically a service plan, not a warranty. If you're going to spring for the service plan only get the manufacturer product not a 3rd party \"product.\" Also, the price of the service plan is negotiable. Now, if you are already looking at lightly used, look at a Certified pre-owned with less than 10K miles per year. Plenty of used cars out there so be picky and look for a cream puff. Best to buy at same time, better financing terms, you have more leverage at point of purchase, less hoops to jump through.\n\nGood call on the car, congrats. May I ask what kind?\n\nSource: Spent my pre-IT career selling cars mostly with Ford and Honda.\n\nEdit, it is a pain in the ass but when you do sell the car you can get a prorated refund of the service plan. The bigger question is why you'd buy a new car when you're driving 30,000 miles a year. You're destroying the value of any car you drive.  You're losing thousands of dollars to depreciation - don't do that to yourself.  \n\nWould I buy the warranty? No, of course not.  I'd have a reasonable emergency fund and go from there.

I consider anything over that to be overkill.  I have only mortgage debt.  So I have about $50k to do something with.\n\nThat said, the regular options are almost maxed out.  I'm putting 9% into my 401k, and my employer only matches 5%. Combined with my stock portfolios, it's about $110k in investments.  I believe equities are overbought at the present moment, so I'm not interested in more stock.\n\nI'd look at bonds, but the US Treasuries are only about 2% right now, and due to go up throughout 2017, so buying now seems like a poor choice, although still possible.

If so, max the HSA -- it works just like a retirement plan.\n\nHow much extra cash do you receive each month that caused this $70k balance? You should be cash flowing enough extra that even if you do these things, you will make cash available for the sort of super-emergency you mention.\n\nYou should plan a kitchen remodel, not suddenly withdraw it from savings, so this shouldn't get in the way of these investment choices. this is probably a dumb question, but why don't you use that money to pay as much into your mortgage debt as possible? or any other debts you might have? What is your income? From that we can determine which of the 401k/IRA/529 is most efficiently minimizes your taxes. If you can't decide, why not do a little of each of a few... e.g.  25k at the mortgage, max out the 401k for the tax break, and move a bit to a better savings account.  (I kinda agree with others that the mortgage is the best of the bunch for returns, but doing anything is better than nothing, so find some acceptable things and just do them to make progress, and then you can revisit it in a year or whenever.) > I'd look at bonds, but the US Treasuries are only about 2% right now, and due to go up throughout 2017, so buying now seems like a poor choice, although still possible.

High-yield savings account? More equities? A bond ETF? Munis? More 401k? The 529 or a trad IRA?\n\nThere are a large amount of options you have available to you and the first thing you need to do is actually figure out what your goals are and work backwards from there. Check to see if your retirement goals are on track and if not dump more into your 401k or an IRA (you can withdraw IRA *contributions* under certain situations without penalty as long as you leave earnings). If you want to help kids pay for college, there's no better time than the present to open up that 529, because giving that money time to grow is a lot better than trying to play catch-up later. If you think you'll do a kitchen remodel, maybe try estimating an amount and a time - it might be best to invest that in a relatively low-risk stocks/bonds mix now or put into the mortgage and use a HELOC later.\n\nYou might also consider the advice that sometimes [it's worth investing your safety net](https://www.betterment.com/resources/personal-finance/safety-net-funds-why-traditional-advice-is-wrong/) to beat inflation and make some gains out of it. Depending on your age if you're young I would avoid even caring about current market prices for a 401k/IRA.  Why?  By the time the money is withdrawn 20-40 years from now the the 10-20% that the market is overbought at the current time will be minimal.  This is the beauty of buying into the market at steady intervals over time.\n\n529 or Coverdell plans would be beneficial especially if you can use extra tax savings (look up which states allow you to deduct from state taxes if you need it).  Coverdell gives you the flexibility if you worry about your children not attending an accredited institution.\n\nWhy not open a Roth IRA if you want flexibility in the money since you  can pull out your contributions at any time without penalty.  \n\nOverall it depends on your risk assessment and timeline. If you were to put some money into a 529 at this time it would give you years to have that amount potentially grow with compound interest. It may seem like a long way off but you may thank yourself later for starting early. I'm not a financial planner, but I wanted to give a different perspective.

In terms of getting the highest salary with relatively few years put in, either computer engineering or electrical engineering will serve you well.  Starting salaries average about $60-70k across the US (higher in bigger cities), just for a bachelor's.  Computer engineering would be more geared toward the software side of things (or integrating software/hardware) and electrical engineering is more hardware/power oriented.  Both are heavy on the design side of things.\n\nSecond to that would be computer science, which is heavily programming based, but focuses more on standard routines, processing, and software applications.  There is less innovative design (in theory anyway), although there is still a lot of programming.  \n\nYou could choose to skip college and pick up programming as a skill on your own, but it may be hard to get a foot in the door without a formal education and starting salaries are going to be much, much lower (if you can even get hired).  I would at least go to technical college and try some of the information technology courses/degrees.\n\nI recommend you go to teamtreehouse.com and sign up for a few of their programming classes (I think its like $25/month) and see how you like it.  You can do it now as a high school student, and get a head start to see what you like.  Create a few websites for folks based on what you've learned and add it to your resume.  Its also a nice side business to have.\n\nThe more software/server oriented you are, the more chances you'll have for a flexible work schedule (assuming you pick an employer who offers this) such as working from home.

Computer Science degrees are usually very math and theory based, or they are software engineering based. If you go to a school that is math / theory based, you will come out ready to do research. If you go to a school that is SE based, you'll be ready for most software engineering jobs. My university's program was a hybrid which is ideal in my opinion. Starting salaries for a bachelors degree are in the $50-$70k range, Masters usually start around $80k.

Why am I getting this?\n\nNo, unemployment is an *example* of what it's for.  Generally, it's for when state or local governments give you money.  In many cases that's for unemployment, but there are other cases too.\n\nIn your case, it sounds to me like when you did your 2015 taxes (presumably in 2016), you found that you had overpaid Colorado by $257.  So Colorado sent you a check for $257.  You may now owe federal tax on that $257 that you received.\n\nI am not a tax professional, but I believe that you owe federal tax on it if you had previously counted it as a tax deduction on earlier federal taxes.  For example:\n\nLet's say you paid Colorado $1000 during the regular course of the year, but when it came time to file, you found that you really only owed them $743.  So they'll send you a $257 check.  BUT: If you deducted your Colorado taxes off of your federal taxes, then if you told the federal government you paid Colorado $1000 (rather than $743), then you underpaid your federal taxes, and thus would now owe taxes on that $257.\n\nAgain, I am not a tax professional.

Pay as much more as you like, the IRS will be happy to take your money.  For every dollar you pay in quarterly installments, it will reduce the amount you pay next spring by $1.\n\nThe easiest way to pay is to use one of the options here:   \nhttps://www.irs.gov/payments\n\nJust specify that you want to make a \"Form 1040-ES payment for 2017.\"  If you pay electronically, you don't have to file any forms.\n\nOr you can mail in your payments with a payment voucher that comes with Form 1040-ES.\n\nThat's for federal taxes.  Most states have an equivalent procedure.  California's is really goofy with varying percentages over the year. Estimated taxes are sort of like withholding is for W-2 employees: you pay in during the year so that at tax time, you just figure what remains to pay or whether you overpaid.\n\nForm 1040-ES is a booklet you can use as a planning tool. It has a worksheet that can help you predict upcoming year's taxes and tells you the amount you can pay in 4 times during the year. \n\nPublication 505 chapter 2 has more about estimating during the year.\n\nYou don't send in Form 1040-ES, but if you are mailing payments it does have payment vouchers. When you file 1040 you put the total paid in this way on line 65.\n\nIn order to fill out 1040-ES, though, you will need to have a guess about your self employment profit, so you can mock up line 12, and find a prediction of your SE tax for line 57, so you can deduct 1/2 SE tax on line 27. That's because first line of 1040-ES worksheet asks for future year's AGI, and that might be line 7 (if you have W-2 job) + line 12 \u2013 line 27 on a dummy 1040.\n\nIf your income is very irregular, it is also possible to make 4 different sized estimated tax payments, based on your actual revenue and expenses for various periods of time. See pub 505 Worksheet 2-9, and use Form 2210 Schedule AI at filing time, if you decide to do that.

Not that I think there's a rule explicitly barring it, but you see rules like \"Traditional 401k contributions can be regular or after-tax\" (no rules like that for Roth) or \"Combined maximum limit for pre-tax 401k and Roth 401k contributions is $18,000\". It doesn't make a practical difference, right? It's all post-tax either way. ALL contributions to a Roth 401(k) are post-tax.  There is no need to contribute first to a t401(k) and roll them over.\n\nMany plans don't have a Roth 401(k) option.  But I would be shocked if your employer had a Roth 401(k) and didn't allow direct contributions.\n\nNow, the advantage(s) to doing a t401(k) to Roth 401(k) conversion with post-tax money are:    \n(1) If you have a balance from before the Roth 401(k) was available, this lets you convert it.   \n(2) Post-tax t401(k) contributions are not subject to the $18,000 limit.  Converting allows you to get more than $18,000 per year into your Roth 401(k).\n\nInteresting article:   \nhttp://www.thinkadvisor.com/2015/01/20/new-roth-401k-rollovers-maximize-after-tax-contrib  Post-tax contributions are separate from Roth 401k contributions.\n\nRoth 401k has a limit of $18k per year. Post-tax contributions are only limited by the aggregate total limit for 401k plans ($54k for 2017 including all employer and employee contributions).\n\nPost-tax contributions can be rolled over in-plan to the Roth 401k, which is why some people call them the \"mega\" backdoor Roth. However, any earnings on the post-tax contributions will be taxed. If you roll over your contributions frequently, you won't have much earnings, so won't pay much tax.\n\nAs for investment options, I would recommend either using 100% in the target date fund, or splitting your money yourself among your (excellent) index fund choices.

She graduated in June, and has been working as a waitress since the weekend she got home. I had her ask how she was payed, and the explanation she got was some complex nonsense (at least hearing it second hand), but the gist of it was that she would be paid by check for her hours and take her cash tips home, unreported. In hindsight, that should've raised my eyebrows. \n\n\nRegardless, August comes and the income isn't enough, so she gets herself another part time job at a retail store. This is great, she's being considered for a full-time position now, and interviews at the end of the month. \n\n\nIn November, her vehicle took a dump on her, and got to a point where it couldn't go above 50mph, and never run for than an hour. Her payments were higher than she needed to be paying, and it wasn't the first time it had given her issues, so she opted to sell it for enough to pay off her loan and have a small down payment for a new vehicle. \n\n\nCome new car shopping time, and she has the credit (barely) to get a higher interest loan, but not the income, because all she can prove is the retail job. Our credit union agrees to refinance for her as soon as May, because by then she'll be able to prove the waitressing income and have more time established at job B (now more job A). \nShe agrees to pay 4 months at the higher rate, \"knowing\" that come may, her payments will be about half of what they are short term. She closed on i yesterday. Not the best decision, but not my decision. \n\nToday, she goes into her restaurant and asks when she can expect to get her tax forms, and the response she receives is \"we don't do that here\". \n\nSo, what is our recourse here? The payments she is making now are unsustainable. Short term it's doable, as her family is helping, but long term it's not, and she is relying on this promised refinance. Is there a way we can still prove this income without a W-2? \n\nEDIT: Upon further investigation, she doesn't even get checks for her hours. Just cash with the noted hours. I don't know the extent to this places record keeping, but it's a one-off, family owned place. There are some employees on the books, but the wait staff is not. She does well to deposit more than 60% of her earnings, as she likes to keep some cash on hand too.

Of course, she can't do this without reporting the employer to the IRS.\n\nIf that's the route she decides to take (and I strongly suggest she does because the penalties for tax evasion are far greater) she can go here https://www.irs.gov/uac/here-is-what-to-do-if-you-are-missing-a-w-2\n\nBest of luck. >\"we don't do that here\"\n\nWas the emphasis on the word \"here\"?\n\nMaybe they do that at the main office or at the accounting office.  Maybe they were trying to tell her to wait and she'll get her W-2 in the mail.\n\nPerhaps the local restaurant manager doesn't know when she will get her W-2 because they are mailed from the owner's office and nobody tells him anything. Re: car financing - \n\nYou don't need a check/W-2 job to verify income to procure financing, as long as you would qualify otherwise. You can show bank statements with regular cash deposits to get a paper trail of her cash income.  Are you sure they just didn't mean that they don't hand out tax forms at that location? If it's a major restaurant usually corporate sends out tax forms. What? She's an employee.  they have to pay taxes, report her earnings, and give her a w-2.  Call the IRS?  Is it possible she misunderstood? So whoever processed the loan at the credit union - call them up and tell them the restaurant won't be issuing her a W2. Tell them that you will be saving 100% of her tips and making a weekly deposit to show proof of her income. See what they say. Presumably the employer is also not paying their share of payroll/FICA taxes either,  on top of the withholding issue. If she gets the full time retail position, it may be worth reporting the restaurant to the IRS. They sometimes offer a bounty where they will give you a percentage of the illegally underreported taxes.  it sounds like the restaurant she works for is paying her under the table and committing tax evasion. If she tries to do the right thing and report her income and/or report the business for tax evasion, that's going to set off a series of consequences that will eventually negatively affect her. She will have to pay about 30% of her income in taxes, she'll likely be fired in retaliation for making the report, the restaurant may end up going out of business, and other stuff. \n\nSo, is there any way she can get another restaurant job with a business that is operating legally? The best thing would probably be for her to do that first, and then work out how to resolve the tax situation after she is secure in a new job. That has the added benefit that she'll be working somewhere that issues pay stubs and will therefore have legitimate proof of income.  Worked in restaurants for 4 years.

The. Problem.** Submit a correct Form W-4 with your employer as soon as possible. \n\nIf you can afford to send any payment on time, please do so. Even if it's $10, that will be $10 paid timely. If you can't afford to send anything, file the return on time.\n\nAssuming you e-file your federal return, you should expect to receive your first balance due notice ([CP014](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-cp14-notice)) in the third week of May.\n\nThe balance due on the notice generally has your unpaid tax, plus assessments of penalties and interest. The most common penalties are the Failure To File (FTF) and Failure To Pay (FTP). The IRS interest rate is currently 4% per year, compounded daily on the unpaid tax and penalties. The interest rate can be increased or decreased on a quarterly basis. The FTP accrues until the tax liability is paid at 0.5% of the tax per month or part of a month.\n\nIf you can find a way to pay this balance by the notice due date, you are done. If you can't, you need a payment plan.\n\nMost IRS payment plans require you to be filing compliant. This generally means you have filed all required returns within the prior six years. An IRS payment plan protects you from enforced collections actions, such as wage or bank levies or, in most cases, a [Notice of Federal Tax Lien](https://www.irs.gov/Businesses/Small-Businesses-&-Self-Employed/Understanding-a-Federal-Tax-Lien).\n\nThe short-term payment plan can be up to 120 days, and it is called a Full Payment Agreement. With this plan, there is no requirement for a fixed monthly payment. The Service calculates the balance due out to 120 days from the request date, and you agree to pay in full by that due date. During the 120 days you could make one payment or 100 payments. There is no fee to request this agreement.\n\nIf you need more than 120 days, the next payment plan is a formal Installment Agreement (IA).\n\nWith an IA, you agree to a monthly payment amount and a fixed due date. The general rule is (**the amount due on your notice / 72**) = your minimum payment. There is a one-time [user fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5gy4bx/irs_user_fees_for_monthly_payment_plans_will/) to establish an IA, and you may qualify for a reduced fee.\n\nWhen an IA is accepted the monthly FTP rate is generally reduced to 1/4%. With a regular IA, you receive [a monthly reminder notice](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Understanding-your-CP521-Notice).\nYou have the option of sending payments by mail, and there are many [electronic payment options available](https://www.irs.gov/Payments).\n\nYou can also request a Direct Debit Installment Agreement (DDIA) by providing your bank routing and checking account number. The [user fee](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5gy4bx/irs_user_fees_for_monthly_payment_plans_will/) for a DDIA is generally reduced if you qualify. There are no monthly reminder notices issued on a DDIA.\n\nMissed payments, late payments, payments with non-sufficient funds, or a new balance due can result in a default status. There is generally an $89 fee to reinstate any defaulted agreement.\n\nAny refunds you claim on future federal (and possibly state) tax returns will be offset to the unpaid balance due. If an offset occurs, you will be [sent a notice](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Understanding-your-CP49-Notice).\n\nYou can set up new payment plans at IRS.gov [Online Payment Agreement](https://www.irs.gov/Individuals/Online-Payment-Agreement-Application).

Sometimes the number can change pretty wildly.\n\nIf you two are married and take the standard deduction of 12,600 and the 2 personal exemptions of 4050 each, it brings your taxable income down to 24,300 which would make you owe $2714. which while still a lot is significantly less than $3600. Either my assumptions are wrong, or you something is inaccurate or incomplete in the software you are using.\n\nIf you can't pay all at once, the IRS will work with you to set up a payment plan. The important thing is to file on time! There are separate penalties for paying late and not filing at all.\n\nNote: There is no \"normal\" amount of taxes to be taken out. You need to put a number of allowances on your W4 which will determine what gets taken out of your paycheck. How did you come up with owing $3,600?  I went to a tax calculator on TaxAct, https://www.taxact.com/tools/tax-calculator.asp, put in your income, married filing joint, no deductions or credits, and the result had your total tax bill of $2,701.  File your taxes and if you can't come up with the money, then arrange a payment plan with the IRS.\n\nAnd get a new W-4 and fill it out correctly so this doesn't happen again. Be sure to check your paystubs that the correct amount is being withheld. IRS usually will work with you if you call them to try to work something out. Sometimes they even let you take it out of your next return, make a payment plan, etc. Learn from your mistakes and make sure you \"ALWAYS\" check your paychecks for accuracies and NEVER just \"trust\" your HR department or anyone else in general with YOUR money. ALWAYS check for accuracy with any transaction this includes bank deposits, store transactions, etc as well. People fat finger, put off things, or flat out don't care sometimes. It is your responsibility to make sure enough is getting taken out fo your taxes. \n\nI would still file on time and see what you can work out with the IRS. They will work with you as long as you don't ignore them and take some initiative.  You husband might not need a new car to fix a fuel line.  A fuel line is just a tube of metal.  Does he have a good mechanic?  Fixing a car is usually way cheaper than getting a more expensive car.  Just from your note, it doesn't sound like you have good financial team work.  You talk about your car, his car, his saving for new car, my emergency saving, and so on.  Not trying to criticize, just saying how it sounds to an impartial reader.  Good luck.   Itemizing is more complicated, but it can be very helpful. I work part-time at the moment, because of my health issues, and we itemize. There was one year our medical costs, after insurance, were more than 50% of income. It was an insanely bad year, but by itemizing, we had a nice refund. If your medical expenses are greater than a certain percentage of your income, then you can claim them against taxes. For the future, keep in mind that income tax withhholding is *not* a loan to the government unless you are *over-*withholding. Tax payments throughout the year (every quarter) are generally mandatory and you may be penalized if you don't make minimum payments. Withholding is just an aid for making those payments, so you need to review your pay stubs to ensure it is being done correctly. If you want to read the IRS publication about taxes, it is Publication 17.  Long, dry, and boring, though.\n\nThe installment agreement documents are Form 9465 and 433-F.

Keep it up. And when you paid it all OFF, keep it up. But pay ON your savings! Good for you!!\n\nYou didn't come here looking for advice, but I'm gonna give you some anyway.\n\nYou've made a good start -- now it's time to consolidate your gain, by \n\n(a) continuing to pay down the credit cards. If  you can afford the minimum payment this month, and **if you don't add to the debt on the card**, you can afford the same amount next month. \n\n(b) Put the credit cards away, get yourself on a cash basis for at least until you're at zero debt. \n\n(c) Take the money you were paying on the card that's now at zero debt, and add it to the amount you pay on the highest-interest card. Again, **do not** reduce the payment to the minimum each month.\n\n(d) Celebrate the melting away of your debt by creating a spreadsheet and tracking the amounts. You can do this for free, rather than signing up for some subscription service. If in the process, you learn a little more, good for you. \n\n(e) Start building your emergency fund, even if only slowly. You might find it useful to set up a separate bank account for this, rather than using the one you normally use. I don't have any debt (other than my home), but I wish I had the motivation to save as you do to reduce your debt. Awesome! Good for you man! Keep it up! Awesome! Keep up the great work! =) Are you paying the credit cards individually?  What are the interest rates?  Ever thought about consolidating?  You can try going to your local bank and inquiring about an unsecured loan (or secured loan using your car or other collateral).  \n\nThere are also peer lending sites like lendingclub which usually have lower rates than credit card companies do.  Might be nice to get everything into one payment.\n Congrats on the progress. Continue to put as much as possible into paying it off. The way I look at it for student loans is that, once this shit is paid off, I'm going to have an extra $450 to put towards what I want. I haven't gotten to that point in my journey, but every time my debts go down I get a little bit happier. \n Great work!  I am sure it feels good to see the progress. Great job!!!!
